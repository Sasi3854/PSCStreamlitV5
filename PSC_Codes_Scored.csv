00011,Certificates & Documentation - Ship Certificate,,,Process
01101,Cargo ship safety equipment (including exemption),"(SOLAS) Required certificate for firefighting, lifesaving, etc. If missing/expired, the ship is illegal to sail since critical safety equipment compliance is unverified. PSC usually detains ships lacking this cert, as it undermines multiple safety aspects.",9,Process
01102,Cargo ship safety construction (including exempt.),(SOLAS) Verifies hull/structural integrity standards. Absence suggests structural components or watertight integrity might not meet SOLAS – a detainable breach of seaworthiness.,9,Process
01103,Passenger ship safety (including exemption),"(SOLAS) Mandatory for passenger vessels; without it, the ship cannot carry passengers legally. PSC would prevent operation due to the heightened risk to many lives on board.",9,Process
01104,Cargo ship safety radio (including exemption),(SOLAS) Ensures GMDSS radio outfit is as required. Missing this cert means long-range distress communications might be compromised – very serious for emergency response. Likely detention until an interim certificate or waiver is obtained.,8,Process
01105,Cargo ship safety (including exemption),"(SOLAS) Integrated certificate (on some ships) covering construction, equipment, radio. Its absence is effectively the same as multiple major certs missing, hence a ship is considered unsafe to proceed.",9,Process
01106,Document of compliance (DoC/ ISM),"(ISM Code) Company’s ISM certification. If a vessel’s managing company lacks a valid DoC, the ship’s whole Safety Management System is not recognized – a major non-compliance. Vessels have been detained or even banned from departing without a valid DoC/ISM framewor​maritime-mutual.com】.",9,Process
01107,Safety management certificate (SMC/ ISM),"(ISM Code) Ship-specific ISM certificate. A missing or invalid SMC usually results in immediate detention, as the ship is deemed not under a compliant safety management regime. ISM failures are the top cause of detentions globall​maritime-mutual.com】. Score 10 reflects that lack of SMC implies systematic safety oversights.",10,Process
01108,Load lines (including Exemption),"(Load Line Convention) Without a valid Load Line certificate, there’s no assurance the ship’s freeboard and loading are safe. Overloading risk is high. PSC treats this as detainable – no Load Line cert = no sail.",9,Process
01109,Decision-support system for masters on pass. ships,"(SOLAS V) Required for passenger ships to assist in emergencies (often a specialized software/manual). If not provided, master’s ability to make optimal decisions in crises (like damage control) is reduced. It’s a significant safety aid; its absence is a moderate-to-high concern.",7,Process
01110,Authorization for grain carriage,"(Grain Code) A document certifying the ship’s stability arrangements for bulk grain. Without it, carrying grain can lead to severe stability issues (grain shift). PSC will insist on this authorization (or approved grain stability data) before allowing grain loading – a major concern but rectifiable by proper loading plan or exemptions.",7,Process
01111,Liquefied gases in bulk (CoF/GC Code),"(Gas Carrier Code) Certifies an LPG/LNG carrier meets design/equipment standards for hazardous gases. Missing this is very severe – the ship should not carry such cargo. Likely detention until a valid CoF is produced or cargo offloaded, due to extreme fire/explosion risks.",8,Process
01112,Liquefied gases in bulk (ICoF/IGC Code),(Modern gas carriers under IGC Code) – Same severity reasoning as 01111: essential for legal carriage of LNG/LPG under current standards.,8,Process
01113,Minimum safe manning document,"(SOLAS V) States the minimum crew numbers/qualifications. If not on board, or if manning is below that level, the ship is legally undermanned – a detainable situation. PSC views undermanning as directly increasing accident risk (fatigue, emergency response capability); ships have been detained until additional crew joi​crclass.org】.",9,Process
01114,Dangerous chemicals in bulk (CoF/BCH Code),(Old Bulk Chemical Code) Certificate for older chemical tankers. Absence means the vessel’s structure/equipment for toxic or reactive chemicals isn’t verified – an unacceptable situation. Would be treated on par with other fitness certs (detention or no loading of such cargo).,8,Process
01115,Dangerous chemicals in bulk (ICoF/IBC Code),(IBC Code) Certificate for modern chemical tankers. Similarly critical – without it the ship should not transport IMO Class chemicals. Non-compliance would result in detention or cargo refusal due to pollution and safety hazards.,8,Process
01116,Operational limitations for passenger ships,"Some passenger ships have explicit operational limits (e.g., wave height, area). This entry implies documentation of those limits. If missing, the vessel might unknowingly operate beyond safe conditions. It’s a moderate issue; PSC will require clarity on any restrictions to ensure compliance.",6,Process
01117,International Oil Pollution Prevention (IOPP),"(MARPOL Annex I) Proves ship has oil pollution prevention equipment (e.g. oily water separator) and procedures. No IOPP = potential illegal oil discharge. PSC treats it as highly detainable (ship cannot legally carry oil/fuel without it). In effect, a ship without IOPP is a huge pollution risk and often targeted for detailed exa​safety4sea.com】.",9,Process
01118,Pollution prevention by noxious liquid sub in bulk,"(MARPOL Annex II) Required for chemical tankers carrying noxious liquids (categories X, Y, Z). Missing NLS cert is similar to missing IOPP but for chemicals – very serious (ship shouldn’t be carrying those cargoes). PSC likely detains or restricts cargo operations until certificated.",8,Process
01119,International Sewage Pollution Prevention Cert.,"(MARPOL Annex IV) Required for ships >400 GT or >15 persons for sewage treatment/holding compliance. If absent, the ship technically shouldn’t discharge sewage at sea. It’s a moderate environmental cert; PSC will cite it and likely require one before departure, but not usually immediate detention unless the ship is actively found polluting.",6,Process
01120,Statement of Compliance CAS,"(MARPOL Annex I) CAS applies to older single-hull tankers to assess structural condition. If a tanker required to undergo CAS lacks this Statement, it indicates the vessel may be too old/risky to carry heavy oil. PSC in port states that enforce CAS will detain or ban such a tanke​file-rqgsxjhhjrkkp4ut9spfnu】, considering it high severity due to heightened spill risk in aging hulls.",7,Process
01121,Interim Statement of Compliance CAS,"As above, if only an interim compliance is in effect (perhaps during the CAS process). If even that is missing when needed, it’s treated similarly – the tanker’s continued operation is in question. High severity for older tanker operation.",7,Process
01122,International ship security certificate,"(SOLAS XI-2/ISPS) Indicates ship meets ISPS security standards. Absence means the ship has not been audited for security measures – a serious security breach. Many ports will refuse entry or detain a vessel without an ISSC, given global security post-9/11. Severity is very high (the ship might be considered a security risk with no valid ISSC).",9,Process
01123,Continuous synopsis record,"(SOLAS XI-1) The CSR is a history of the ship’s identity and ownership. If missing or not updated, it’s a documentation lapse that could hinder traceability (important for security and safety history). PSC will require it to be updated. It’s moderately important legally but has no direct immediate safety impact – hence a lower score.",5,Process
01124,International Air Pollution Prevention Cert,"(MARPOL Annex VI) Certifies compliance with engine NOx limits, fuel sulfur limits, etc. Without IAPP, the ship cannot prove it meets air emission rules (e.g., might be burning high-sulfur fuel illegally). PSC sees missing IAPP as a serious environmental non-compliance; in emission control areas this can lead to detention/fine​safety4sea.com】. We score it high – essential for legal operation post-2020 sulfur cap.",8,Process
01125,Engine International Air Pollution Prevention Cert,"(MARPOL Annex VI) Individual engines >130 kW need EIAPP certificates (NOx compliance). Missing certs mean the engine may not meet NOx standards. PSC will flag it – the ship might be allowed to sail short term but must rectify with the flag State. It’s a significant compliance issue, especially in NOx Emission Control Areas.",7,Process
01126,Document of compliance dangerous goods,"(SOLAS II-2/19) If a ship (not a tanker) carries packaged dangerous goods, it needs a DoC (indicating fire protection arrangements, etc., are in place). Without it, carrying DG is unsafe and not permitted. PSC would likely detain or forbid loading of dangerous goods until the ship is properly certified – a high safety risk if not compliant (e.g., insufficient fire protection for DG cargo).",8,Process
01127,Special purpose ship safety,"(SPS Code) For vessels like research ships, cable layers, etc., carrying special personnel. Missing this cert means those vessels might not have implemented additional safety measures for people on board. PSC treats it seriously for those types – moderate-high severity (not as common, but important in that niche).",7,Process
01128,High speed craft safety and permit to operate,"(HSC Code) High-Speed Crafts (fast ferries, etc.) are high-risk by design. Without an HSC Safety Certificate or valid Permit to Operate, a high-speed craft is not allowed to operate at high speeds or carry passengers. PSC would detain it immediately – the margins for error on HSC are low, so every required certificate must be in force.",9,Process
01129,Mobile offshore drilling unit safety,"(MODU Code) For drilling rigs or vessels – ensures they meet special safety standards. If a MODU lacks this, it shouldn’t operate; PSC (or coastal state) would very likely shut down its operation until certified, due to high potential hazards (blowouts, etc.). High severity in offshore context.",8,Process
01130,INF certificate of fitness,"(INF Code) Required for ships carrying category I, II, III nuclear materials. If missing, such extremely hazardous cargoes are being carried without special precautions – unacceptable. PSC would detain or refuse entry for the ship with INF cargo but no certificate. Very high severity (nuclear material incidents have huge consequences).",8,Process
01131,International AFS certificate *),"(AFS Convention) Certifies the ship’s hull paint doesn’t contain banned toxins (like TBT). If missing, it’s a regulatory issue but not an acute danger – PSC will typically request the cert or a survey. (If it suggests the ship might still have TBT paint, the vessel might be required to renew coating). Low-moderate severity.",5,Process
01132,Tonnage certificate,(TONNAGE 1969) Needed primarily for port fees and to determine convention applicability. Missing it doesn’t directly affect safety; PSC will ask for it to be produced. Minor severity (though legally required).,4,Process
01133,Civil liability for oil pollution damage cert.,"(CLC Convention) This cert (often from P&I insurer) shows the ship has insurance for oil spill liability. If missing (for tankers carrying >2000 tons of oil), the ship cannot enter many ports (no insurance = no entry by law). PSC will detain or deny entry because any spill would otherwise have no guaranteed compensation. High severity from a regulatory perspective (financial security), though not a physical safety issue – but effectively, ship is not allowed to operate without it.",7,Process
01134,Polar ship certificate,"(Polar Code) Required for ships operating in polar waters, outlining ice class and polar survival arrangements. If a ship is trading in Arctic/Antarctic without this, it means it may not be prepared for polar hazards (ice navigation, cold safety). PSC (or the polar coastal state) would likely detain or restrict it from polar routes until compliant. High severity for vessels actually in those regions (risk of oil spills or casualty in sensitive polar environment).",8,Process
01135,Document for carriage of dangerous goods,"(Possible duplicate of 01126?) – Ensures vessel’s arrangements for DG (ventilation, detection) are adequate. Same rationale: essential for legal carriage of dangerous cargo; without it, carrying DG is a major safety hazard and not permitted.",8,Process
01136,Ballast Water Management Certificate,"(BWM Convention) Indicates compliance with ballast water treatment standards to prevent invasive species. If missing, the ship might be using untreated ballast – an environmental violation. PSC increasingly enforces this; some countries detain ships or deny ballast discharge if no valid certificate. Moderate-high severity (environmental risk – not immediate like a spill, but significant ecological harm potential; also a legal must-have now).",7,Process
01137,Civil liability for Bunker oil pollution damage cert,"(Bunkers Convention) Similar to CLC but for fuel oil on all ships >1000 GT – proof of insurance for bunker spills. Missing it is a compliance gap; many ports will not let a ship sail without it. PSC will detain until one is provided. Moderately high severity due to legal/financial implications (less than CLC for tankers, but still important as bunker spills can be costly).",6,Process
01138,International Energy Efficiency Cert,"(MARPOL Annex VI) Confirms the ship has a verified Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) or a Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (SEEMP). If missing, it’s an administrative lapse in environmental documentation. PSC will note it but it doesn’t pose immediate danger. Low severity – need to obtain the certificate to satisfy Annex VI.",4,Process
01139,Maritime Labour Certificate,"(MLC 2006) Indicates the ship passed inspection of crew living/working conditions. If a required MLC certificate is absent or expired on a ship to which MLC applies, it signals potentially serious breaches of crew welfare. PSC can detain ships for MLC non-compliance especially if crew are found in bad conditions (and MLC cert missing reinforces that possibility). High severity due to legal requirements and the fact that 10% of detainable deficiencies relate to MLC issue​gard.no】.",8,Process
01140,Declaration of Maritime Labour Compliance (Part I and II),"(MLC 2006) Accompanies the MLC certificate detailing how the ship meets MLC standards. If missing, the ship’s compliance regimen is unclear. PSC treats it as a significant deficiency – it must be on board along with the certificate. Not having it could contribute to detention if other crew welfare problems are observed.",7,Process
01199,Other (certificates),Any other certificate/documentation issue not specified. Severity varies with the document’s importance. Generally a mid-level score – it could range from trivial (e.g. a missing crew list) to critical (a certificate not listed elsewhere). PSC will evaluate case-by-case.,5,Process
00012,Certificates & Documentation - Crew Certificate,,,Process
01201,Certificates for master and officers,"(STCW) If the Master or any officer required to hold a license (deck or engine) lacks a valid certificate or flag endorsement, the ship is not legally manned. This is one of the gravest deficiencies – e.g., an unlicensed Master/OOW is an accident waiting to happen. PSC will detain the ship until a properly certified officer is on board. (It’s both a safety issue and a violation of STCW and flag state law.)",10,Process
01202,Certificate for rating for watchkeeping,"(STCW) Ratings on bridge/engine watch (able seafarer, oiler, etc.) need watchkeeping certificates. If those are missing, watch teams may be unqualified, raising collision/grounding risks especially if they need to take over in emergency. PSC treats it seriously – likely requiring crew change or additional training documentation. High, though not as high as for officers, since officers oversee watches.",8,Process
01203,Certificates for radio personnel,"(STCW IV) The person in charge of radio communications (often an officer with GMDSS GOC) must be certified. Without a GMDSS operator license, distress communication may be mishandled. PSC will likely detain unless another certified person can fulfill the role – a major safety and SOLAS compliance issue.",8,Process
01204,Certificate for personnel on tankers,"(STCW V/1) Officers and key crew on oil/chemical/gas tankers need special tanker safety training endorsements. Missing these means crew might not know how to handle cargo emergencies (fire, toxicity). For example, no “Tanker Familiarization” for a chief officer carrying chemicals is very serious. PSC can detain or at least bar the vessel from loading until compliant, considering the heightened fire/explosion risk.",7,Process
01205,Certificate for personnel on fast rescue boats,"(STCW VI) Crew designated to operate fast rescue boats must be certified. If those certificates are missing, the ship may not be able to conduct effective man overboard rescues. It’s a safety issue (especially on passenger ships or tankers required to have FRBs). PSC will require the crew get certified or refrain from tasks beyond capability. Moderate severity (critical in an MOB event, but only specific crew affected).",6,Process
01206,Certificate for advanced fire-fighting,"(STCW VI) Most officers are required to have Advanced Fire-Fighting training. If an officer (especially Chief Officer or Second Engineer who lead fire teams) lacks this, it weakens onboard emergency response. PSC will cite it and expect immediate rectification (could even detain if multiple officers are missing it, as that indicates non-compliance in safe manning). Moderate severity per individual, higher if systemic.",6,Process
01209,Manning specified by the minimum safe manning doc,"(SOLAS V/MLC) If the actual crew on board is below the numbers/roles on the Safe Manning Document, the ship is undermanned. E.g., the Safe Manning requires 1 Chief + 2 watch officers, but only 1 watch officer is on board – that is a major violation. PSC will detain the ship until required crew joi​crclass.org】. Undermanning has been a factor in many incidents (fatigue, inadequate watch). This is very severe.",9,Process
01210,Certificate for medical first aid,"(STCW VI) At least one seafarer (usually an officer) must have Medical First Aid training. If none are certified in even basic first aid, crew might not get proper immediate treatment for injuries, raising risks. PSC will require someone gets trained or added. It’s a moderate deficiency – important but can be compensated short-term (via telemedicine guidance, etc.).",5,Process
01211,Cert for personnel on survival craft & rescue boat,"(STCW VI) Any seaman assigned to lifeboat/rescue boat launching or command must have Proficiency in Survival Craft (PSC) certification. Without it, crew may mishandle lifesaving appliances in an abandon-ship scenario. PSC will not tolerate non-certified boat handlers – this is crucial for evacuation. Likely they will detain until enough crew have the cert or restrict vessel’s operations (e.g., reduce persons on board). High moderate severity.",6,Process
01212,Certificate for medical care,"(STCW VI) The designated “medical person in charge” (often the Chief Officer) needs Advanced Medical Care training. If not certified, advanced treatment on board (for serious injuries/illnesses) might be inadequate. It’s a moderate issue – PSC expects at least one person with this training, especially on long voyages far from shoreside hospitals.",5,Process
01213,Evidence of basic training,"(STCW VI) All crew must have Basic Safety Training (BST). If some seafarers lack proof of BST (perhaps new crew without certificates on hand), that’s a compliance gap and a safety concern – those individuals may not know how to use firefighting gear or survival craft. PSC will likely detain or disembark any crew who cannot prove basic training. Moderately severe (the ship can sail if those crew are removed or quickly trained).",5,Process
01214,Endorsement by flagstate,"(STCW I/10) Officers’ certificates issued by one country must be endorsed by the ship’s flag State. If an officer only has a foreign cert with no flag endorsement, legally they are not recognized by the flag. PSC treats this similar to not having a certificate at all – very serious administratively. Often results in detention or removal of the officer until endorsement is obtained. High severity because it invalidates the officer’s authority on board.",7,Process
01215,Application for Endorsement by flagstate,"Sometimes an officer may sail on proof of application for endorsement (a temporary measure). If the grace period passed and only an application (no actual endorsement) is aboard, PSC will flag it. It’s moderate – if within allowed time, fine; if overdue, it’s like 01214 (serious). Typically not detainable if still in process within STCW-allowed window, but must be resolved.",5,Process
01216,Certificate for personnel on ships subject to the IGF Code,"(STCW V/3) Crew on vessels using gases as fuel (e.g., LNG-powered ships) need special training (IGF Code). If those certificates (Basic or Advanced IGF training) are missing for engineers or bridge officers, that is a major hazard – mishandling LNG/LPG fuel can lead to catastrophic fires/explosions. PSC will likely detain until crew are properly qualified. High severity given the explosive nature of gas fuels.",7,Process
01217,Ship Security Officer certificate,"(STCW VI/5 & ISPS) The designated SSO must be trained and certified. Without a certified SSO, the ship’s ISPS compliance is in doubt – the crew may not handle security threats properly. This is moderately severe; while it doesn’t threaten immediate physical safety like a fire, it poses security risks. PSC will demand a certified SSO on board (they may accept that the Master or another officer has it – one of them must).",6,Process
01218,Medical certificate,"(MLC/STCW I/9) Each seafarer must have a valid medical fitness certificate. If crew medicals are expired or missing, they might be unfit for duty (risk of sudden incapacitation or illness at sea). PSC views missing medicals as a serious MLC breach – a potentially unfit crew member can endanger themselves and others. Ships have been detained for widespread lack of valid medicals. High severity (especially for key personnel like bridge watchkeepers – an undiscovered medical condition could lead to incapacitation during critical moments).",7,Process
01219,Training and qualification MLC - Personnel safety training,"Suggests crew must be trained in personal safety and social responsibilities (which is part of BST) and possibly other MLC-related safety training (like hygiene, bullying & harassment prevention, etc.). If records are missing, it’s a moderate issue – usually covered by STCW basic training anyway. PSC will note it as a documentation/training gap.",5,Process
01220,Seafarer' employment agreement SEA,"(MLC 2006) Each seafarer must have a signed employment contract (SEA) meeting MLC requirements. Unsigned or substandard SEAs are one of the most common detainable MLC deficiencie​gard.no】. If crew don’t have valid SEAs, it implies potential abuse (unpaid wages, excessive hours). PSC takes this very seriously – they often detain ships until proper contracts are in place or resolve conflicts (e.g., crew complaining of different terms). High severity due to legal and welfare implications.",8,Process
01221,Record of employment,"Discharge books or certificates of discharge that note a seafarer’s service. If not provided, it’s an MLC requirement not met, but relatively minor in terms of ship operation. PSC will advise rectification (ensures seafarers can prove sea time for their career). Low severity.",4,Process
01222,Doc evidence for personnel on passenger ships,"(STCW V/2) Crew on passenger ships must have crowd management and safety training for assisting passengers. If crew designated to assist passengers in emergencies lack this, passenger evacuation efficiency and panic control are compromised (e.g., untrained crew might fail to manage crowds during a mustering). PSC on passenger vessels will check this; deficiency could lead to reduction in passenger count or detention until training done. Moderate-high severity given potential impact in an emergency.",6,Process
01223,Security awareness training,"(STCW VI/6) All seafarers need at least security awareness training, and those with security duties need a higher level. If certificates for these are missing, it’s an ISPS compliance gap. PSC will note it – it doesn’t immediately threaten the ship unless a security incident occurs, but it’s a mandatory requirement. Moderate severity – easily addressed by short courses, but still important for overall security posture.",5,Process
01224,Certificate for rating able seafarer deck/engine and electro-technical,"(STCW II/5, III/5, III/7) These are STCW certifications for experienced ratings (able seaman, able engine, ETR) introduced in 2010 amendments. If required by the vessel’s safe manning and missing, PSC will flag it. It affects the career progression of ratings and sometimes manning requirements. It’s moderately severe: lack of certified ABs or motormen might violate manning regulations and indicate crew may not have proven skills. The ship could be detained if manning doesn’t fulfill flag requirements.",6,Process
00013,Certificates and Documentation - Document,,,Process
01302,SAR co-operation plan for pass.ships on fixed trade,"(SOLAS V) Passenger ships on certain fixed routes (e.g., ferries) must have a plan for cooperation with SAR services. If missing, coordination in a rescue might be slowe​virtuemarine.nl】. PSC sees this as important (especially after incidents like Estonia); they’d require it before sailing. Moderate severity – crucial for passenger rescue preparedness.",6,Process
01303,Unattended machinery spaces (UMS) evidence,"(SOLAS II-1) If a ship operates engine room in UMS mode, documentation (class notation, test records) should prove it meets criteria. If this evidence (like periodic test results of alarms) is lacking, PSC may be concerned the ship isn’t truly safe for UMS at sea. They might insist on manned engine watches until proper evidence is provide​safety4sea.com】. Moderate severity (affects operation mode, not immediate danger if mitigated by manning).",5,Process
01304,Declaration of AFS compliance,(AFS Convention) Smaller ships or those not requiring the full AFS Certificate carry a declaration that their hull coating complies (no TBT). Missing declaration is a minor documentation gap. PSC will ask for it but it doesn’t alone cause detention (unless there’s reason to suspect banned paint). Low severity.,3,Process
01305,Log-books/compulsory entries,"Various logs (deck log, engine log, GMDSS log, oil record book, garbage record, etc.) have required entries. If essential entries are missing (e.g., no entries of fire drills in log, or oil record book not maintained), it raises compliance and potential cover-up concerns. For instance, an empty Oil Record Book might imply illegal discharges not recorded – PSC would investigate such cases vigorousl​safety4sea.com】. Score moderate: exact impact depends on which log – an incomplete radio log (minor) vs. oil record (major with possibly higher effective severity if intentional omission is suspected).",4,Process
01306,Shipboard working arrangements,"(SOLAS II-1) The intact and damage stability booklet (or loading stability data) is essential. Without approved stability info, the crew cannot ensure the ship’s loading is within safe limits – a situation that has caused capsizings (e.g., Herald of Free Enterprise). PSC will detain ships lacking stability booklets or if they are wildly out of date, as this is critical for safe loadin​classnk.com】. Score 9: fundamental to seaworthiness.",9,Process
01307,Maximum hours of work or the minimum hours of rest,(MARPOL VI) Required for new ships – documents the ship’s attained EEDI. Missing file doesn’t affect operation; it’s mostly for verification by auditors. PSC would just note it. Very low severity (environmental documentation).,2,Process
01308,Records of seafarers' daily hours of work or rest,"(MARPOL VI) All ships must have a SEEMP onboard (a plan to improve energy efficiency). If missing, it’s an administrative breach with no direct safety effect. PSC will require one, but it’s a low severity compliance issue.",3,Process
01309,Fire control plan - all,"Some flag States issue an MLC inspection report or certificate. If required and missing, PSC may wonder if the ship underwent its mandated MLC inspection. It’s moderately important for crew welfare verification – PSC may scrutinize working/living conditions more closely in its absence.",4,Process
01310,"Signs, indications","(MLC Reg.5.1.5) Ships must have a procedure for crew to lodge confidential complaints about MLC violations. If missing, crew may have no remedy for issues like unpaid wages or bullying except going to PSC directly. PSC views this as significant (it’s a specific MLC requirement). Not having it is a deficiency that needs correction (post the procedure, train crew on it). Moderate severity (indirectly affects morale/compliance culture).",5,Process
01311,Survey report file,"Many seafarers’ employment conditions are governed by a CBA between owner and unions. MLC requires that if a CBA applies, it’s available on board. If missing, PSC can’t verify if terms in SEAs meet at least CBA minimums – could hide substandard conditions. Moderate severity (documentary but important for ensuring fair conditions).",5,Process
01312,Thickness measurement report,"After installation or annual servicing of AIS, a test report may be provided. If missing, it’s minor (the real issue is if the AIS itself is working – see code 10113). PSC might ask if AIS has been tested; absence of a report is an administrative gap. Low severity, assuming AIS itself is operational.",4,Process
01313,Booklet for bulk cargo loading/unloading/stowage,"(SOLAS III/Reg.17) All ships must have a plan (and means) to recover a person from the sea (Man Overboard rescue). If missing, crew might not have thought through how to retrieve an unconscious person from water. This is quite important, especially with small freeboard or high freeboard ships needing special equipment (nets, Jason’s cradle, etc.). PSC will ask for the plan; lacking one is a moderate safety issue. They’ll likely detain until a suitable recovery arrangement is in place if the ship can’t demonstrate one.",6,Process
01314,Shipboard oil pollution emergency plan (SOPEP),"(MARPOL Annex I, Chap.8) Oil tankers conducting Ship-to-Ship (STS) cargo transfers must have an STS transfer plan and keep records of each STS operation. If the ship does STS and has no plan or logs, it’s violating MARPOL (and is a spill risk due to lack of procedure). PSC in regions where STS is common (e.g., off Malaysia, Gulf of Guinea) will detain vessels for improper STS operations. High-moderate severity: STS has led to spills, so regulators require strict adherence to procedures.",6,Process
01315,Oil record book,"(Polar Code) Ships in polar waters must carry a PWOM detailing ship-specific procedures for ice navigation, cold weather operations, emergency equipment in polar conditions, etc. If a ship trading in Arctic/Antarctic lacks a PWOM, it is a serious safety and environmental concern (the crew may not be prepared for polar hazards). Polar PSC (e.g., Canada, Russia) would likely detain it until a proper manual is provided. Score 8 for extreme environment preparedness.",8,Process
01316,Cargo information,"(MLC A2.5.2) MLC requires shipowners to have insurance or financial security to repatriate crew in cases of abandonment. If this certificate (often from P&I club) is missing, and if crew are owed repatriation, they might be stranded. PSC treats this as a serious MLC compliance item after several high-profile crew abandonment cases. They will demand evidence of coverage (which pays for flights, subsistence, etc., if owner fails to) – high moderate severity as it directly affects crew welfare in worst-case scenario.",7,Process
01317,Cargo record book,"(MLC A4.2) Another MLC-required security, covering shipowner liability for crew injury, illness, death (essentially guaranteeing compensation). Missing this means crew might not get due compensation or care. PSC will similarly view it seriously – it became mandatory from 2017, and lacking it is detainable under MLC in many ports. High moderate severity due to direct impact on crew well-being and legal compliance.",7,Process
01318,P & A manual,(If not covered in earlier codes) This ensures the ship is fit to carry certain dangerous cargoes (solids in bulk or packaged DG). Absent documentation of compliance (for the class of cargo carried) is a major risk factor. The ship might be carrying hazardous cargo without proper safety arrangements. High severity and likely detainable for certain cargoes.,7,Process

00002,Structural condition,,,Equipment
02101,Closing devices/watertight doors,"All openings (hull doors, ramps, watertight interior doors) must seal properly. If they fail, flooding can spread uncontrollably in an accident. E.g., an inoperative watertight door on a ro-ro deck is very hazardous (ro-ro ferry losses have been linked to open doors). PSC often tests random doors/hatches. A significant failure (door can’t close or seal) will typically result in a detention until fixed, as it violates damage control integrity. High severity – directly affects survivability in flooding.",8,Equipment
02102,Damage control plan,"SOLAS requires a damage control plan on board, showing boundaries and steps to control flooding. If missing, crew might be less organized in an emergency. It’s a documentation issue – PSC will require one on board but likely won’t detain solely for this if the structural gear (pumps, W/T doors) are fine. Still, moderate severity since it aids crew response.",5,Equipment
02103,Stability/strenght/loading information and instruments,"The ship must have approved stability data and any required loading instrument (for bulkers, container ships etc.) functioning. If this info or instrument is not available, the ship could be unknowingly loaded to unsafe stress or stability margin​classnk.com】. PSC sees that as critical – e.g., bulk carriers must have a working loading computer to avoid structural collapse. Expect detention or requirement to unload cargo if safe loading can’t be verified. Very high severity (multiple bulk carrier losses in the 90s led to strict enforcement of this).",8,Equipment
02104,Information on the A/A-max ratio (Roro/pass.only),"For certain ro-ro passenger ships, damage stability calculations include an A/A<sub>max</sub> factor (relative floodable deck area). They must have data to prove compliance. If not, the ferry’s damage stability might be insufficient. PSC in EU (Stockholm Agreement) and elsewhere will hold such a ship until it demonstrates compliance, because it’s directly related to survivability if car deck floods. High-moderate severity (ferries have sunk due to inadequate stability with open decks).",7,Equipment
02105,Steering gear,"The steering gear (rudder actuators, pumps, controls) must be fully functional and redundant. Any deficiency – e.g., one steering pump inoperative, or control transfer not working – is treated as very serious. Loss of steering is a well-known cause of collisions/groundings. PSC typically tests steering during departure; if it fails or is unreliable, the ship will be detained until repaired. This is a critical system for safe navigation.",9,Equipment
02106,Hull damage impairing seaworthiness,"Any significant hull damage (e.g., a fracture in the side shell, holing, heavy indents, buckling) that impairs seaworthiness will almost certainly justify detentio​fma.fo】. This is among the most severe structural issues: it means the hull’s ability to keep water out or bear loads is compromised. PSC not only detains such a vessel, but often requires immediate class survey and repair before voyage. (Example: a crack in the main deck or bottom could lead to catastrophic failure in heavy seas.) Score 10 – extreme immediate risk.",10,Equipment
02107,"Ballast, fuel and other tanks","Significant structural problems in tanks (e.g., holed ballast tank, severely corroded fuel tank boundaries) can lead to pollution or loss of stability. If a fuel tank is leaking internally, it could introduce oil into ballast or vice versa (contravenes MARPOL and weakens structure). PSC will involve class and likely detain if structural integrity of tanks is in doubt. High severity (both pollution and stability concerns).",8,Equipment
02108,Electric equipment in general,"Under structural condition maybe referring to general electrical fittings not posing ignition risk or not compromised by structure (this code’s placement is odd; possibly meant for structural fire safety of electrical cable penetrations, or electrical wiring integrity in damp spaces). If PSC finds widespread unsafe wiring or electrical fittings that could fail (leading to fire or loss of vital systems), they issue deficiencies. It’s moderately severe – mostly impacting reliability and fire safety. (If it’s about intrinsically safe electrical gear in dangerous spaces, then severity would be higher, but that might fall under other categories).",6,Equipment
02109,Permanent means of access,"Newer tankers and bulkers must have means for inspectors to access critical structural areas (per SOLAS XI-1/Reg.3-6). If those means (railed platforms, ladders, etc.) are missing or unsafe, it hampers proper inspection and maintenance of structure. PSC will note it; while not an immediate threat, lack of access can hide serious structural issues. They might require it fixed by next special survey. Moderate severity.",5,Equipment
02110,"Beams, frames, floors-op.damage","Heavy items or operations can bend or deform internal hull members (frames, deck beams, bottom floors). If PSC sees bent frames from cargo operations or slamming, it signals weakened hull sections. A few slightly bent frames = deficiency to monitor; many or severe deformations = detention until class approves strength is intact. We score 7 on average – could be higher if deformation is extensive (risking structural collapse under load).",7,Equipment
02111,"Beams, frames, floors-corrosion","Widespread wastage of structural members (frames, beams, etc.) due to rust significantly reduces hull strength. PSC (often via class measurements) treat advanced corrosion as a very serious issue – e.g., >25% diminution usually requires immediate repair. Bulk carriers with corroded frames have broken in half. So this often leads to detention or at least a Condition of Class before next voyage. High severity.",8,Equipment
02112,Hull - corrosion,"General hull plating corrosion: if it’s more than superficial (flake rust), e.g., pitting, grooving, or areas of reduced thickness, it threatens watertightness and strength. PSC may gauge thickness or demand ultrasonic reports. Heavy corrosion (wastage beyond allowable) on shell or deck is detainabl​fma.fo】. E.g., a holed side shell plate from rust = immediate detention until repaired. High severity.",8,Equipment
02113,Hull - cracking,"Cracks in the hull, even small, tend to propagate and can cause catastrophic failure. Especially alarming are cracks in high-stress areas (deck, bottom, near hatch corners on bulkers). PSC will detain for any crack that goes through the plating (through-thickness​fma.fo】. A crack is essentially an active failure in progress – thus extremely severe. (They might allow a temporary repair or limit cargo until permanent fix, under class direction, but not sailing as-is.)",9,Equipment
02114,Bulkhead –corrosion,"Watertight bulkheads (e.g., engine room forward bulkhead, collision bulkhead, transverse holds bulkheads in bulk carriers) are crucial to limit flooding. If they are severely corroded, flooding from one compartment can spread. PSC will insist on repairs quickly. Less visible externally, but if known, it’s serious – possibly detention depending on extent and which bulkhead. Moderate-high severity.",7,Equipment
02115,Bulkheads - operational damage,"Bulkheads can be damaged by cargo operations (e.g., grabs in bulk holds denting bulkheads) or grounding, etc. Dented bulkheads may not be as strong against water pressure or cargo load. PSC will consult class; if damage is beyond class-allowable deformation, they’ll detain for repair. Score ~7 given it could degrade watertightness (though if not cracked, just dented, might be tolerable short-term with class okay).",7,Equipment
02116,Bulkheads - cracking,"Cracks in bulkheads (especially watertight or tank bulkheads) are very severe – they allow flooding or fluid transfer when they should be sealed. E.g., a crack in a collision bulkhead could let seawater from a bow breach flood the next compartment, defeating the design. PSC will detain until repaire​fma.fo】. High severity.",8,Equipment
02117,Decks - corrosion,"Deck plating (main deck on tankers/bulkers, or vehicle decks on ro-ros) with significant wastage can lose strength. A corroded main deck on a bulker can fail under load (and has, in structural failure incidents). PSC focuses on deck condition; heavy rust with flakes may be allowed with condition, but wasted thin deck sections will trigger detention for repairs. Score 7, leaning higher if far advanced.",7,Equipment
02118,Decks - cracking,"Cracks on deck, especially main deck of bulk carriers or tankers, are red flags for structural failure (e.g., many bulk carrier losses in the ’90s were preceded by deck cracks). PSC will not allow a vessel to sail with active deck crack​classnk.com】. Expect detention until at least temporary welded repairs and class clearance. High severity.",8,Equipment
02119,Enhanced survey programme (ESP),"Oil tankers and bulk carriers have to undergo an ESP with close-up surveys of critical structure at certain intervals. If the ship has not complied (e.g., overdue ESP survey or missing thickness gauging reports), PSC will be very concerned that unseen structural problems exist. They may detain or insist on an immediate survey before departure. It’s essentially a serious compliance breach for high-risk ships. High moderate severity (ties directly to structural safety oversight).",7,Equipment
02120,Marking of IMO number,"SOLAS XI-1 requires the IMO number to be permanently marked on the hull and in the engine room. If missing, it’s a minor issue of identification – doesn’t affect structure or safety. PSC will instruct to paint it on. Very low severity.",2,Equipment
02121,Cargo area segregation,"This refers to the separation between cargo areas and other parts of the ship (e.g., cofferdams, double hull, safe separation of cargo tanks from machinery spaces on tankers). If segregation is compromised (say a cofferdam is eliminated or a door added between cargo hold and engine room), that’s dangerous – vapors or flooding can travel where they shouldn’t. PSC would detain if, e.g., an unauthorized opening was cut in a bulkhead that breaches segregation. Otherwise, if just documentation of segregation arrangement is lacking, moderate. If actual physical segregation is breached, very high. Average moderate score with potentially higher case-by-case.",5,Equipment
02122,"Openings to cargo area, doors, ..., scuttles","Any opening from accommodation or engine spaces into cargo areas (or on deckhouses in cargo zone) must be properly sealed/weathertight (or vapor-tight for tankers). If doors or portlights into cargo holds or hazardous areas are not secure, it’s a big hazard (water ingress or gas leakage into accommodation). PSC will cite, and likely detain until sealed, any non-conforming opening. E.g., a broken hatch on a ro-ro deck or an open skylight into a hold is unsafe. High moderate severity.",6,Equipment
02123,"Wheelhouse door, -window","This is likely about weathertight integrity of the navigation bridge. A wheelhouse external door or window that doesn’t secure could let water in on the bridge in heavy weather (which can damage electronics, wash crew out, etc.). It’s a moderate issue – not as critical as hull openings lower on the ship, but still needs fixing. PSC will write it up and expect repair at next port. Low-moderate severity (unless in polar conditions or such where any opening could be dire).",4,Equipment
02124,Cargo pump room,"(Tankers) The cargo pump room on tankers is a critical, hazardous space (with flammable vapors). Structural or safety deficiencies in the pump room – e.g., corroded bulkhead between pump room and engine room, non-functional pump room bilge system, or unable to inert – are extremely severe. A failure could lead to explosion or flooding that spreads. PSC will often enter pump rooms for inspection; any significant issue (holes, heavy oil leaks, fan failure) is often detainable until remedied because pump room explosions have caused tanker losses. Score 9 – vital to tanker safety.",9,Equipment
02125,Spaces in cargo areas,"Refers to conditions of spaces like cofferdams, voids, duct keels, etc., in cargo area. If those aren’t maintained (e.g., flooded, corroded, filled with cargo residue), it could hide structural issues or create free surface effect. PSC will note if those spaces are not accessible or in poor shape. Moderate severity – more of a maintenance and inspection concern unless it leads to structural weakness (then severity rises).",6,Equipment
02126,Cargo tank vent system,"(Tankers) Cargo tank venting (pressure/vacuum valves, vent lines) must work to prevent over/under-pressure in tanks. If this system is faulty (e.g., PV valves seized or vent lines clogged), a tanker can literally explode or implode. PSC knows this – vent malfunctions on tankers are detainable deficiencie​safety4sea.com】. High severity – no departure until vents are fixed or cargo offloaded, as the consequences of failure are catastrophic (explosion or structural collapse of tank).",9,Equipment
02127,Safe access to tanker bows,"(SOLAS II-1/3-3) Tankers must have a safe passageway (usually centerline catwalk) to the bow, because deck may be slippery or blocked by deck cargo/pipelines, and in heavy weather crew might need to go forward. If that access is missing or damaged (e.g., broken catwalk), crew can’t reach critical equipment (anchors, bow mooring) safely. PSC will require repairs. It’s a moderate safety/work issue. (Not detainable unless port operations demand immediate use of unsafe access – then they’d require mitigation like harnesses or delay operations).",6,Equipment
02128,Bulk carriers additional safety measures,"(SOLAS XII) Bulk carriers have extra safety features (like water ingress alarms, reinforced bulkheads, loading sequence restrictions). If these additional measures are not in place or not functioning (e.g., cargo hold flooding alarm inoperative), the bulk carrier is at much higher risk of sudden failure (many bulkers sank from undetected water ingress​safety4sea.com】. PSC treats, say, a non-working hold water level detector or missing “loading triangle” marks as serious – likely detention or at least require loaded in benign conditions until fixed. High severity since it relates to known bulk carrier casualty causes.",8,Equipment
02129,Bulkhead strength,"If PSC suspects that bulkheads (especially cargo hold bulkheads on bulkers) lack required strength – perhaps due to wastage or damage – they will be very concerned. Weak bulkheads can collapse under cargo or flooding pressure, causing progressive failure. For example, if a transverse bulkhead in a bulk carrier is buckled or repaired poorly, they may detain until a class reassessment is don​fma.fo】. High severity as it directly affects structural integrity in loaded condition.",8,Equipment
02130,Triangle mark,"Bulk carriers have “loading triangle” marks on hatch coamings indicating the region of partial loading for stability considerations. If not marked, crew might not adhere to proper loading sequences. This is a minor issue in itself (the absence of paint doesn’t sink the ship, it’s informational). PSC will require it to be marked but it’s low severity.",3,Equipment
02132,Water level detectors on single hold cargo ships,"Single-hold bulk carriers (generally old ones) must have bilge alarms in the hold to warn of flooding (after the Derbyshire investigation). If those detectors are not fitted or not working, the crew might get no warning of progressive flooding until it’s too late. PSC finds this very serious – bulk carriers have been detained for missing or faulty water ingress alarms, as it’s a life-saving early warnin​safety4sea.com】. High severity – likely detention until alarms operational because without them a single hold ship could flood and founder without crew awareness.",8,Equipment
02133,Asbestos containing materials,"Asbestos is banned on ships (aside from sealed old installations) due to health hazards. If PSC finds loose asbestos (e.g., in pipe lagging in accommodation or engine room), it endangers crew health and violates SOLAS (since new asbestos use is forbidden). They won’t necessarily detain solely for presence if it’s not airborne, but they will demand a plan for removal or encapsulation. If crew are at risk of exposure (friable asbestos), they may detain until hazard mitigated (local port state regulations vary). We give moderate – important for crew long-term health, though not an immediate sinking/fire risk. (It can also cause port state refusal to let crew work on it until handled).",6,Equipment
02134,Loading/Ballast condition (Tanker),"Tankers, especially oil tankers, must adhere to approved loading/ballasting sequences to avoid excessive hull stress (to prevent structural failure). If PSC finds the tanker in a condition outside its approved loading manual (e.g., too much ballast in mid tanks causing sagging, or carrying heavy cargo without ballast in required tanks), the ship could suffer structural damage or buckling. This is very severe – an improperly loaded tanker could literally break apart. PSC would likely stop cargo operations and detain until the loading is brought within limits or verified by class. Score 9 – critical to hull girder integrity.",9,Equipment
02199,Other (Structural condition),"A catch-all for any structural issue not specifically listed, which could range widely. PSC may use this if they observe something like loose structural brackets, minor deformation not categorized, etc. Severity will depend on the specific issue. We assign 7 on average – structural issues are generally taken seriously, and “Other” might cover things like minor cracks in non-watertight partitions (less severe) or early signs of fatigue. If it were something severe, PSC would usually categorize it above, but any structural uncertainty is medium-high priority.",7,Equipment
00003,Water/Weathertight condition,,,Equipment
03101,Overloading,"(Load Line) If the ship is submerged beyond its assigned load line marks, it’s overloaded. This is an extremely severe violation: the vessel has less freeboard and stability margin than required. PSC will detain the ship on the spot until the excess cargo/fuel is offloaded – sailing overloaded has led to vessels founderin​classnk.com】. Score 10 (immediate risk of loss of stability in bad weather).",10,Equipment
03102,Freeboard marks,"The Plimsoll load line marks must be correctly positioned and visible. If they are not (e.g., painted over, or draft numbers not readable), it’s a deficiency: it hinders verifying the ship isn’t overloaded. It suggests possible intentional deception in loadin​parismou.org】. PSC will insist on remarking them. Alone it’s moderate severity (administrative), but it often accompanies actual overloading concerns (which are very severe).",5,Equipment
03103,"Railing, gangway, walkway and means for safe passage","This relates to physical safety for crew moving about the ship: e.g., guardrails on exposed decks, a safe gangway for boarding, and clear walkways. Missing or damaged rails or slippery, obstructed walkways can cause falls overboard or injuries. PSC will cite such hazards – they have led to crew accidents. Not usually detainable unless extremely unsafe (e.g., no railing at all around deck edges – then the ship might be detained as unsafe for crew per ISM/MLC). Typically moderate: requires urgent correction (crew rig temporary lifelines, etc.).",6,Equipment
03104,Cargo and other hatchways,"Cargo hatch covers (on bulkers, general cargo ships) and other large hatches must be weathertight. Leaking or non-securing hatch covers are a major cause of cargo damage and vessel loss (water ingress through hatches has sunk many bulk carriers). PSC often does a hose or chalk test on hatch seals. If significant leakage or inability to secure is found, they will likely detain the ship until repaired, because heavy seas could flood the hol​fma.fo】. Score 8 – critical for vessel survival in rough weather. (Detention is common for seriously compromised hatch covers, especially if heavy weather is expected on route.)",8,Equipment
03105,"Covers (hatchway-, portable-, tarpaulins, etc.)","This extends to portable covers and tarpaulins used on some older ships or smaller craft. If those are missing or in bad shape, the holds aren’t weather-protected. A tarpaulin hatch system, for example, relies on good canvas and battening; if rotten or improperly secured, holds can flood. PSC will require immediate correction (replace tarps, fix battens) or restrict sailing. High moderate severity – not as robust as steel covers to begin with, so any defect is serious in heavy weather.",7,Equipment
03106,"Windows, side scuttles and deadlights","All portholes and windows below the freeboard deck (or in weather-exposed areas) must be intact and have deadlights (storm covers) that can be closed. If bridge windows or accommodation portholes are broken or their deadlights can’t be closed, big waves could smash in and flood compartments or disable the bridge. PSC will definitely detain a ship if bridge windows are shattered or missing in heavy weather season. If it’s a minor crack, they might allow temporary fixes but still a deficiency. We rate 6 overall; can escalate to higher if it’s a gaping hole situation (which would be detainable for sure).",6,Equipment
03107,Doors,"Weather-tight doors in superstructures or deckhouses (e.g., exterior doors to accommodations, stores, forecastle) must seal when closed. If an external door is warped or its gasket missing, green sea can enter (e.g., many fishermen have been lost due to an open door to engine room). PSC checks a sample of external doors – a door that cannot be dogged tight is a significant hazard. They’ll typically detain until fixed or restrict operations (like not sailing in rough weather​fma.fo】. For instance, a broken bow visor door on a ro-ro would be detention (as after the Estonia sinking). Score 7.",7,Equipment
03108,"Ventilators, air pipes, casings","Ventilators and air pipes (for tanks, engine room, etc.) extend above deck and have closing devices (canvas sleeves or automatic float caps) to prevent water ingress. If vents are damaged or their closures inoperable, seawater can down-flood into compartments in heavy seas – a known cause of engine room floodin​parismou.org】. PSC often finds wasted air pipe heads or broken closing flaps and considers it serious (detainable if it directly threatens watertightness of a main compartment). They will require immediate repairs or temporary seals. High moderate severity.",7,Equipment
03109,Machinery space openings,"Openings like engine room skylights, funnel uptakes, and emergency exits on deck must be weathertight or at least have coamings per Load Line rules. If they can’t be closed (e.g., a skylight that won’t shut), engine room could flood in a storm, leading to loss of power and possibly sinking. PSC treats non-closing machinery space openings as very serious – likely detention until rectified. E.g., an unsecured funnel door or missing gasket on skylight = major risk. Score 7.",7,Equipment
03110,Manholes / flush scuttles,"Flush deck manhole covers and small scuttles need proper gaskets and bolts tightened. If a manhole on deck is not secured or its seal is bad, sea water can leak directly into tanks/holds. It’s a frequent minor deficiency (sometimes crew leave manhole covers loose after inspection). PSC will require them properly bolted before sailing. It’s moderately severe depending on what it leads to – usually easily fixed on the spot by tightening down.",6,Equipment
03111,Cargo ports and other similar openings,"Side shell openings like shell doors, bunker doors, and cargo side-ports must close watertight. A failure or gap in these is extremely dangerous (waterline openings). The Herald of Free Enterprise disaster (open bow door) is a prime example. PSC will detain ships if a side shell door cannot be dogged or is found open at sea. Score 7 – even if the opening is high above water in calm conditions, weather can change. For anything near waterline, it’s likely a 10 (immediate detention) if not secure.",7,Equipment
03112,"Scuppers, inlets and discharges","Hull valves for scuppers (deck drains), sea inlets, and overboard discharges must be operational and non-leaking. If a sea inlet valve is stuck open or a discharge can’t be closed, it’s a potential uncontrolled flooding poin​parismou.org】. PSC often checks engine room sea chest valves; a seized or leaking overboard valve is detainable because if connected piping fails, you can’t stop water ingress. Score 7 – basically any through-hull that isn’t secure is high risk.",7,Equipment
03113,Bulwarks and freeing ports,"Bulwarks protect the deck; freeing ports are openings in bulwarks to let shipped water drain off deck quickly. If freeing ports are blocked (e.g., by cargo, or rusted shut) or too few, water can accumulate on deck, causing stability loss (free surface effect) and potential deck immersion. PSC will ensure freeing ports on cargo decks are clear – a common deficiency is “freeing port shutters seized”. They’ll require immediate clearing (it’s easy usually). Significant in heavy weather but straightforward to fix, so moderate severity.",5,Equipment
03114,"Stowage incl. uprights, lashing, etc (timber)","Carriage of timber deck cargo has special requirements (timber uprights, steel wire lashings, etc., to essentially turn the timber into a solid block). Improperly secured timber dramatically raises capsizing risk (due to shift or loss of buoyancy when wet). PSC in timber trades (Canada, Baltic) will detain a ship if timber deck cargo isn’t secured per the Timber Code – many fatal accidents historically from shifted timber. So if a ship has timber on deck and lashings/uprights are deficient, high severity (likely detention to re-stow/lash properly). If no timber cargo at the time, they may just note deficiency. We score 6 overall, but when applicable with cargo, it’s effectively a 9 in context.",6,Equipment
03199,Other (load lines),"Any other deficiency affecting water/weather-tight integrity not specifically listed. It could range from small (like a vent pipe without a cover) to large (improper hatch securing mechanism). By default moderate severity, but actual impact depends on the item. PSC will evaluate its effect on seaworthiness – significant items here would be treated like the similar listed items.",6,Equipment
00004,Emergency Systems,,,Equipment
04101,Public address system,"(SOLAS III) On passenger ships (and many cargo ships), the PA system is used to give emergency announcements. If it fails, crew and passengers might not get vital instructions during a fire or muster. On a passenger vessel, that is serious – crowd management relies on it. PSC would require immediate fix (redundancy is hard; they might employ handheld loudhailers as temp measure). We score 6 (important on pax ships; minimal impact on small cargo vessels).",6,Equipment
04102,Emergency fire pump and its pipes,"(SOLAS II-2) The emergency fire pump is a backup that provides firefighting water if the main pumps fail (e.g., due to engine room fire). PSC commonly tests this pump during drills, and it is a frequent detainable item – a non-working emergency fire pump means the ship can’t fight a fire if main power is los​safety4sea.com】. Many detentions (and even banning orders) have resulted from repeat failure of fire pumps. This is top severity: PSC typically detains the ship until the fire pump is operational because without it, a fire at sea could rage uncontrolled.",10,Equipment
04103,"Emergency lighting, batteries and switches","(SOLAS II-1/III) Emergency lighting (with battery backup) illuminates escape routes, muster stations, and essential equipment when main power fails. Deficiencies (e.g., many emergency lights not working or batteries not holding charge) are very commo​safety4sea.com】. It’s detainable if extensive – imagine a nighttime evacuation in darkness. PSC often checks emergency lighting during drills; if it fails, they will insist on immediate repairs. We score 8 – critical for safe evacuation and firefighting. (This is reportedly one of the most common deficiency codes globally, highlighting maintenance issues, though not always detainable unless a large portion is out).",8,Equipment
04104,Low level lighting in corridors,"(SOLAS II-2) Passenger ships have low-level (floor) lighting or photoluminescent strips along escape routes. If these are missing or not glowing (not “charged”), it’s a safety issue but with redundancy (there’s also emergency lighting above). PSC will note it and require correction (replace faulty strips, etc.). It’s moderate severity: important for guiding people if smoke obscures overhead lights, but failure doesn’t completely black out the route if other lights work.",5,Equipment
04105,Location of emergency installations,"This likely refers to the IMO symbolic labels/signs showing location of emergency equipment (fire extinguishers, hydrants, shutdowns, etc.). If signs are missing or faded, responders could lose precious time searching. It’s a minor issue to fix (put proper stickers) but aids crew and shore firefighters. PSC will require proper signage – low severity alone.",4,Equipment
04106,Emergency steering position communications/ compass reading,"(SOLAS V) If the ship must steer from the emergency steering station (local steering gear room), there must be a way to communicate with the bridge and know the ship’s heading (a rudder angle indicator and a compass repeater or talk-back for helm orders). If those communications fail (for example, sound-powered phone to steering flat is broken, or no compass indicator aft), in a scenario where bridge control is lost, the crew in the steering gear room won’t know what heading the ship is on or when to turn – a dangerous situation. PSC will test communication to emergency steering during drills. Failure is a serious deficiency – they might not detain if they implement a manual workaround (like handheld radios), but it’s risky. We give 6.",6,Equipment
04107,Emergency towing arrangements and procedures,"(SOLAS II-1 & MARPOL I) Tankers must have emergency towing arrangements at bow and stern, and all ships should have a procedure for being towed if disabled. If these aren’t in place (no ready towing bridle, or crew not familiar), a drifting ship in distress is harder to assist, risking grounding. It’s an important contingency; PSC will check on tankers especially. Likely moderate – they’ll want the equipment and plan in place (e.g., on tankers, strongpoints and towing pennants must be pre-rigged). Not typically detainable unless imminent need, but definitely noted.",5,Equipment
04108,Muster list,"(SOLAS III) The muster list (station bill) details each crew member’s emergency duties and must be posted. If it’s missing or outdated, crew might be confused during an emergency – who goes to fire team, who lowers lifeboats, etc. PSC nearly always checks this document. If incorrect or not posted, it’s a deficiency to fix immediately (captain can draw one up on the spot). Not usually a cause for detention by itself (easy to rectify), but significant for compliance.",5,Equipment
04109,Fire drills,"(SOLAS Chapter III/MSC Circ.) PSC often requires a fire drill during inspection. If the crew’s performance is poor (e.g., they don’t know how to start fire pump, or don’t don breathing apparatus correctly), PSC will issue a deficiency and can detain the ship for ISM failures because untrained crew in fire response is extremely dangerou​safety4sea.com】. Many detentions include “crew not proficient in fire drill” as an ISM-related ground. This is scored 7 – it reflects on training; if severely lacking, it escalates to 9 or 10 as an ISM detention (since inability to fight fire threatens the ship).",7,Equipment
04110,Abandon ship drills,"Similar to fire drills, but evaluating lifeboat/liferaft evacuation. If PSC observes chaos during an abandon ship drill (crew unable to launch lifeboat, passengers not directed, etc.), it’s a major indicator of poor training. They will detain under ISM if they judge the crew cannot safely evacuate in an emergency. For instance, if engine crew can’t start the lifeboat engine or boat hooks can’t release, detention is likely until resolved. Score 7, with same caveat: if extremely bad, it contributes to an ISM detention.",7,Equipment
04111,Damage control plan,"(Duplicate of 02102 but listed again – possibly for verifying it’s readily accessible to crew). As noted, missing damage control plan is moderate. Perhaps here PSC wants to see crew familiarity with it. If crew doesn’t even know of it, they might cite training issues too.",5,Equipment
04112,Shipboard Marine Pollution emergency operations,"(MARPOL I & II) Oil tankers and ships >400 GT must have a SOPEP (for oil spills); NLS carriers need SMPEP. If missing, crew might not know how to respond to a spill, whom to notify, etc. PSC treats absence of SOPEP seriously (it’s a clear MARPOL violation). They might detain a tanker in port until it obtains one because an oil spill without a plan could be chaotic. Score ~6 (documentation, but vital during pollution emergencies and required by law; e.g., USCG detains vessels without SOPEP).",6,Equipment
04113,Water level indicator,"Could refer to an emergency water level indicator in the engine room (to detect flooding) or for passenger ships with large open spaces. For example, SOLAS required passenger ships to have bilge level alarms in machinery spaces post-Costa Concordia. If such an indicator is required and not working, flooding might go unnoticed until too late. Particularly on UMS ships at night, an engine room bilge alarm failure is grave – the vessel could flood without anyone knowin​safety4sea.com】. PSC would likely detain until bilge alarms fixed. Score 8.",8,Equipment
04114,Emergency source of power - Emergency generator,"(SOLAS II-1) The emergency generator (E/G) provides electricity for lighting, communications, fire pump, etc., when main power is lost. PSC often lists a nonfunctional emergency generator as a detainable deficienc​safety4sea.com】. A vessel that plunges into darkness during a blackout cannot launch boats or fight fires effectively – a life-threatening situation. This is about as severe as it gets for emergency readiness. PSC will detain the ship until the emergency generator works (or exceptionally allow one voyage in calm conditions with portable emergency power if absolutely needed, but that’s rare).",10,Equipment
04115,Safe areas,"After recent cruise ship incidents, regulations require designated “safe areas” on passenger ships (with shelter, food, communication) for passengers if they must muster for extended periods. If these arrangements (including ventilation, sanitary, etc.) are not as per requirements, it’s a deficiency in crisis management capability. It’s not immediately life-threatening unless an incident occurs, but it’s an MLC/comfort and safety compliance issue. PSC will note and require rectification (esp. on large passenger ships). Moderate severity.",6,Equipment
04116,Means of communication between safety centre and other control stations,"On large passenger ships, there is often a central safety command post (for coordinating firefighting and damage control) separate from the bridge. There must be reliable communication (phones or talk-back) between this centre and places like the bridge, engine control, etc. If those comms are faulty, emergency coordination could break down – e.g., the bridge might not know what firefighting teams in machinery spaces are doing. On a cruise ship, PSC would take that seriously (but often an internal issue to fix). Moderate-high severity (because in a big emergency, lapses in communication can cost lives).",6,Equipment
04117,Functionality of Safety Systems,"This is broad, possibly used when a test of an integrated safety system fails. For example, a “master alarm” system that should show fire zones might be inoperative, or remote emergency shutdowns for fuel didn’t activate during drill. If PSC notes that an entire safety system (like fixed CO₂ or fire detection network) did not function as designed when tested, they will consider detaining the ship. Essentially, multiple safety sub-systems failing points to ISM failure. High severity – needs immediate correction under class/ISM oversight.",8,Equipment
04118,Enclosed space entry and rescue drills,"(SOLAS III) Now mandatory: crew must drill enclosed space rescue (entry with SCBA) every few months. If PSC asks and finds the ship hasn’t been conducting these drills or crew are clueless about rescuing someone from a tank, they will record a deficiency. Given many fatalities in tanks due to improper rescue attempts, this is quite important. They might not detain on the spot if they quickly do a satisfactory drill after guidance, but it flags training shortfalls. Moderate severity, trending higher since regulators focus on it (Paris MoU had a CIC on enclosed space entry).",6,Equipment
00005,Radio communication,,,Equipment
05101,Distress messages: obligations and procedures,"This likely refers to the GMDSS distress alerting procedure and obligations to respond to distress alerts. If PSC questions the radio officer and they are ignorant of distress procedures, or required “Radio Operational” info (like the Muster List’s radio duties) isn’t present, it’s an operational training issue. They may cite ISM if officers don’t know how to send a distress (Mayday) or about obligation to relay/answe​myseatime.com】. Score 6 – important for emergency response; reflect training deficiency.",6,Equipment
05102,Functional requirements,"GMDSS equipment must meet functional requirements for the ship’s Sea Area (A1, A2, A3, A4). For example, a vessel in A3 should have MF/HF DSC or satellite, etc. If a ship lacks any one of those functions (e.g., no MF/HF and not Inmarsat-equipped going into A3), it cannot meet distress communication requirements – a detainable breach. Score 7 – likely detention or restriction to sea area where equipment on board is sufficient.",7,Equipment
05103,Main installation,"The main GMDSS radio installation (combination of equipment) must be working. If, say, the primary MF/HF transceiver is completely dead and the ship relies only on a backup or nothing for long-range, that’s severe. PSC will possibly detain unless voyage is only in A1 (coastal VHF range). High moderate severity – long-range distress capability is compromised.",7,Equipment
05104,MF radio installation,"If required (Sea Area A2 or A3), the Medium Frequency radio (with DSC) must work. If it’s inoperative but the ship has an alternate means (Inmarsat C can cover some functions), PSC might allow interim sailing in A3 (satellite range) but not in purely A2 (because then you have no medium-range coverage). It’s significant but partial redundancy via HF or sat might exist. Score 6.",6,Equipment
05105,MF/HF radio installation,"For A3 ships, the combined MF/HF DSC radio is crucial if outside Inmarsat coverage or as backup. If down, but the ship has Inmarsat C still working, they have distress capability except maybe no direct HF DSC – still serious. If in A4 (polar), HF is primary – absolutely critical; an HF failure in polar region is detainable as they’d have no other way. So severity can range; average 7. PSC will likely detain or restrict to areas with coverage of what’s working.",7,Equipment
05106,INMARSAT ship earth station,"If the ship relies on Inmarsat C for distress in A3 and it’s not working, then it must rely on MF/HF. Many ships no longer carry duplicate MF/HF sets if Inmarsat is main. Thus, no Inmarsat = probably no GMDSS beyond A2 range. PSC will detain in that case or restrict to coastal voyages until fixed. Score 7.",7,Equipment
05107,Maintenance / duplication of equipment,"GMDSS requires either duplication of certain radio equipment or a shore maintenance contract or onboard maintenance capability. If the vessel hasn’t arranged the chosen maintenance option (e.g., no shore contact and no duplicates or no radio maintainer onboard), it’s a compliance gap. It doesn’t immediately stop communications but means if something breaks, they’re not covered. PSC will note it – moderate severity, but they might not detain if all gear is currently operational; they’ll insist the deficiency be rectified (e.g., get a shore maintenance contract) before it breaks.",5,Equipment
05108,Performance standards for radio equipment,"This suggests the equipment on board might not meet IMO performance standards or not be type-approved (e.g., using non-marine VHF sets). If PSC discovers non-approved gear, they’ll require replacement but probably not detain if it’s functioning (unless it clearly malfunctions). Low-moderate severity – a regulatory compliance issue more than an immediate safety one, unless substandard gear fails at a critical moment.",4,Equipment
05109,VHF radio installation,"At least two VHFs (one portable) are required. If the fixed VHF DSC radio on bridge isn’t working, it’s serious as that’s used for short-range distress and routine port communications. But usually portables can cover for voice (not DSC). PSC will definitely require a functioning VHF before departure (most likely repair same port – easy fix usually). This is a frequent deficiency but also frequently fixed on the spot. Score 6 – vital for collision avoidance and local SAR.",6,Equipment
05110,Facilities for reception of marine safety information,"Ships must be able to receive MSI (navigational and weather warnings) via NAVTEX (coastal) and/or SafetyNET (Inmarsat) depending on area. If the NAVTEX receiver is broken and the ship sails through areas where NAVTEX is primary (A2 areas), they might miss storm or nav warnings – hazardous. PSC will want it fixed. If Inmarsat SafetyNET covers the area, they have redundancy. Still, moderate severity as missing MSI can indirectly lead to accidents (like missing a gale warning).",6,Equipment
05111,Satellite EPIRB 406MHz / 1.6 GHz,"(SOLAS IV) The EPIRB is arguably the most crucial distress beacon – if the ship sinks, it automatically sends a distress signal via satellite. If the 406 MHz EPIRB is not onboard or not functioning (battery expired, self-test fails), that is a major distress alerting deficiency. PSC will detain the ship until the EPIRB is fixed or replaced, no exceptions, because without it a sinking might not be promptly detecte​tokyo-mou.org】. Score 9 – critical for saving lives in abandonment (some might even say 10; practically, it’s an urgent fix typically done in port by replacing the unit or battery).",9,Equipment
05112,VHF EPIRB,"Older term – 121.5 MHz EPIRBs were phased out for satellite alerting (now 121.5 is just a homing signal frequency for search aircraft). Modern EPIRBs have 406 + 121.5 MHz. If an old “VHF EPIRB” is referenced, it might mean an old emergency beacon that’s no longer recognized by satellites. If the ship hasn’t upgraded, PSC will note it – but since 2009, 121.5-only beacons are obsolete for satellites. So this is low severity now (the key is 406 EPIRB above).",3,Equipment
05113,SART/AIS-SART,"(SOLAS III) Ships must carry Search and Rescue Transponders (radar-SART or AIS-SART) – typically 2 on >500 GT. If SARTs are missing or not working, survivors in liferafts can’t signal rescuers effectively. PSC in a lifeboat drill often asks crew to activate SART. A non-functional or absent SART is a detainable deficiency if not corrected (they typically require buying or fixing it in port). Score 8 – crucial for locating liferafts in a rescue.",8,Equipment
05114,Reserve source of energy,"(SOLAS IV) GMDSS equipment must have a backup power source (usually dedicated batteries) to run radios for at least 1 hour in distress after mains failure. If these batteries are missing, dead or cannot hold charge (common deficiency if tests show voltage drop), the ship could lose all communications in a blackout – a very dangerous scenario. PSC treats bad radio batteries as a serious issue – they often detain until batteries are replaced because it directly affects ability to call for help in an emergency. Score 8.",8,Equipment
05115,Radio log (diary),"The radio logbook is required to record GMDSS tests, incidents, and significant radio communications. If not maintained, it’s a procedural lapse. PSC will note it but it’s minor – though it can hint at overall lax radio watchkeeping (for example, no weekly EPIRB/GMDSS test entries might cause them to scrutinize equipment readiness). Low severity itself.",2,Equipment
05116,Operation/maintenance,"This is broad, possibly meaning the crew’s ability to operate and maintain GMDSS properly. If PSC finds, e.g., the officers don’t know how to do a DSC test or haven’t done routine maintenance (no recent battery specific gravity checks, etc.), they may issue an ISM-related deficiency. It reflects training and SMS issues. Score ~5 – if gear still works, it’s moderate, but it could escalate if evidence of neglect (like corroded antenna, etc.).",5,Equipment
05118,Operation of GMDSS equipment,"(No 05117 listed; 05118 likely covers use of equipment in an actual scenario). If PSC observes the crew during a drill and they cannot properly send a distress alert or use GMDSS functions, it’s a serious failing. They might cite this to indicate that in an emergency, the crew might not be able to communicate – an ISM issue. They would likely detain for crew re-training or require a dedicated GMDSS operator. Score 7 – safety of life at sea depends on proficient use of distress equipment.",7,Equipment
05199,Other (radio communication),"Any other radio-related deficiency. Could range from antenna damage (which could be severe if it disables comms) to missing posters. The default is moderate severity, but if the issue impacts distress communication, it would be handled with high urgency. PSC will evaluate; for example, a broken MF/HF antenna wire would practically cripple long-range radio – that “other” would be treated like a major equipment failure (score would then be high).",6,Equipment
00006,Cargo operations including equipment,,,Process
06101,Cargo securing manual,"(SOLAS VI Reg.5) The ship must have an approved Cargo Securing Manual (CSM) and use it to properly secure cargo (especially for containers, vehicles, etc.). If it’s missing or not followed, cargo might be inadequately lashed, leading to shift or loss overboard in rough seas. PSC will not detain solely for a missing manual if the cargo on board is well-secured and they can obtain the manual quickly, but it’s a clear compliance breach. If they also see poor lashing as a result of no manual, severity shoots up (they may then detain to restow/relash). Baseline 6 – important for safe voyage, though fixable by obtaining the manual from owner quickly.",6,Process
06102,Grain,"(International Grain Code) If carrying bulk grain, the ship needs a Document of Authorization (indicating it can load grain to certain stability criteria) or must follow Grain Code rules for loading and have grain stability data on board. Absence of documentation or proof of grain stability calculations is very severe – shifting grain has capsized ships. PSC typically will not allow a grain-loaded vessel to sail without approved stability calculations (they might detain it in port and require proper trimming or installation of centerline shifting boards, etc.​classnk.com】. Score 8 – critical for stability; likely detention if not compliant.",8,Process
06103,Other cargo - timber -deck/construction,"(Timber Deck Cargo Code) Carriage of timber on deck requires special fittings (like solid uprights, tensioned lashings, maybe increased freeboard). If PSC finds a ship carrying timber without proper uprights or lashings per its Timber Securing Manual, they will likely detain or at least stop it from sailing until it's rectified – shifting timber dramatically affects stability. Several accidents (like Pearl of Scandinavia",7,Process
06104,Lashing material,"All cargo lashings (chains, straps, etc.) must be in good condition and appropriate for the load. Worn or insufficient lashing material can lead to cargo shift or loss. PSC will cite frayed belts or rusted chains and require replacements. It’s a moderate issue – usually easily fixed in port by grabbing spare lashings (so not typically detainable unless lack of proper lashings has already led to dangerously unsecured cargo).",5,Process
06105,Atmosphere testing instruments,"(SOLAS XI-1 Reg.7) Entry into enclosed cargo spaces (holds, tanks) requires a calibrated 4-gas detector as of 2015. Also, tankers must have instruments to test cargo tank atmosphere (oxygen, hydrocarbon) before entry or during inerting. If these devices are missing or inoperable, crew could unknowingly enter lethal atmospheres – a frequent cause of fataliti8】. PSC views this as a very serious crew safety hazard (and a MARPOL violation for tankers required to monitor inert gas levels). Detention is common if no functional multi-gas meter is on board.",8,Process
06106,Cargo transfer - Tankers,"Equipment used for cargo transfer on tankers (cargo pumps, valves, loading arms) must be reliable. If critical transfer equipment fails (e.g., a cargo pump that can’t stop, or a stuck cargo valve), it can cause spills or inability to control cargo flow. PSC will likely detain a tanker if it cannot safely load or discharge (for instance, emergency cargo pump inoperable, or vapor return system failing during loading). High-moderate severity: operations are halted until fixed due to pollution and safety risk.",7,Process
06107,Cargo operation,"This code might be used if PSC finds unsafe cargo handling practices or procedural violations not covered elsewhere. For example, if a bulk carrier’s loading plan isn’t followed (risking structural damage), or a container ship not following IMDG segregation despite having the plan. It indicates an ISM failure in cargo handling. Severity moderate – could lead to detention if the observed practice poses immediate danger (like loading heavy cargo all to one side causing list). Otherwise, it results in an ISM observation to improve procedures.",6,Process
06108,Cargo density declaration,"Shippers must declare bulk cargo density (for loading calculations and tank top limits). If such information isn’t provided to the master, it’s a violation of SOLAS and IMSBC Code. Without it, loading could overstress the ship’s structure unknowingly. PSC will mostly treat this administratively (ensure the document is obtained before departure). It’s relatively low severity since masters usually demand this info; if it were actually missing, the vessel shouldn’t load until obtained.",3,Process
06199,Other (cargo),"Other cargo-related deficiencies not specifically listed. Could range from using improper cargo gear to poor cargo hold cleanliness for the next load. Average moderate importance. Actual severity will depend on the scenario – e.g., “Other” might be used if a heavy-lift wasn’t properly secured (which would be very high severity requiring immediate action), or something minor like absence of a cargo handling manual copy (low severity). We assign a middle value.",5,Process
00007,Fire safety,,,Process
07101,Fire prevention structural integrity,"Structural fire protection (insulation, fire-rated bulkheads and decks) must be intact. If fire insulation is missing/damaged or holes exist in fire-resisting divisions (from unauthorized penetrations or corrosion), fire and smoke can spread rapidly. PSC often finds missing fire insulation in engine rooms or cable transits not sealed. This is a significant deficiency – the ship can be detained if major fire boundaries (like engine room casing or accommodation decks) are compromised. Score 7 – requires prompt repair (re-insulation, sealing) to restore the fire integrity.",7,Process
07102,Inert gas system,"(SOLAS II-2/Reg.5.5 & IGC) Tankers carrying crude oil or certain chemicals must have a working inert gas system (IG) to keep tank atmospheres non-flammable. If the IG system is inoperative, the tanker is effectively a floating bomb – a spark could cause a catastrophic explosion. PSC will detain a tanker immediately for a non-functional IG syst2】. This is one of the most severe safety issues for tankers, and such detentions are common if IG pressure or alarms fail. The vessel typically must cease cargo operations until IG is repaired or, if not fixable, offload cargo and not sail laden. Score 10.",10,Process
07103,"Division - decks, bulkheads and penetrations","Fire divisions (A-class decks/bulkheads) and the integrity of any cable pipe penetrations through them. If PSC finds, say, cable transits in engine room bulkheads that aren’t sealed with fire-resistant material, or fire doors that don’t meet division requirements, the fire boundary is compromised. They will require immediate sealing of penetrations (often using approved compounds). It’s a high severity issue – unsealed penetrations have led to fires spreading between compartments. The ship could be detained if numerous or major openings are unsealed.",8,Process
07104,Main vertical zone,"On passenger ships, bulkheads dividing the ship into main vertical zones must limit fire spread. If an MVZ boundary (A-60 bulkhead, for example) is found breached or not up to standard (perhaps a fire door left out during modification or insulation damaged), a fire could traverse multiple zones. Given the potential for hundreds of lives at stake on a cruise ship, PSC treats this as very serious – likely detainable until rectified. Score 8.",8,Process
07105,Fire doors/openings in fire-resisting divisions,"Self-closing fire doors in A-class divisions are often found tied open or not closing fully (due to paint, damage, etc.). This is one of the most common deficienci7】. A door wedged open can let fire and smoke spread. PSC will insist the practice stops (no door wedging) and that any faulty door closers be fixed. They may not detain for one bad door if others work (they often just get crew to start fixing it on the spot), but if many fire doors are inoperable, detention is possible under ISM. Score 6 given typical scenario (few doors issue). Crew usually correct it during inspection (e.g., remove wedges, demonstrate self-close).",6,Process
07106,Fire detection,"The automatic fire detection system (smoke/heat detectors, fire alarm panel) is crucial for early warning. If it’s non-functional or zones are in fault, a fire might go undetected until it’s too late. PSC often tests the fire detection by triggering an alarm. Failure of the system or any major part of it (e.g., no alarms in engine room because detector circuit is broken) is a detainable item. They’ll require immediate repair because the ship is essentially “blind” to fir4】. Score 8. (If just a couple detectors are dirty and gave false alarms leading crew to turn off that zone – that is still very serious in PSC eyes; many detentions stem from disabled fire detection zones).",8,Process
07108,Ready availability of fire fighting equipment,"All firefighting appliances must be readily available and in working order (fire hoses rolled out or connected, extinguishers charged, hydrants accessible). Common issues: hydrants blocked by cargo, fire hoses missing or deteriorated, BA sets locked away not ready, etc. PSC writes this up frequently and will detain if, say, none of the fire hoses are usable or fire stations are buried under cargo – because in a fire, time lost accessing equipment can be fatal. Generally score 6 – easy to fix (clear the obstruction, replace a missing nozzle) but significant if widespread.",6,Process
07109,Fixed fire extinguishing installation,"The fixed firefighting systems (e.g., CO₂ flooding system in engine room and cargo holds, Halon or foam systems) must be 100% operational. If PSC finds any indication it may not work – say, CO₂ bottles not correctly connected, or discharge piping heavily corroded, or crew can’t demonstrate the system within required time – it’s a major deficiency. A non-functional CO₂ system is a notorious detention item: an engine room fire without CO₂ backup can’t be controll4】. PSC often verifies the CO₂ room is properly locked/sealed and crew can release CO₂. If any part fails (e.g., a section of CO₂ didn’t discharge in test or someone left valves shut), detention is likely until fully fixed. Score 9.",9,Process
07110,Fire fighting equipment and appliances,"This refers to portable and semi-portable firefighting equipment: fire hoses, nozzles, portable extinguishers, fireman’s outfits, fire axes, etc. PSC commonly finds, for example, missing or expired extinguishers, hoses so old they burst under pressure, or not enough fireman’s outfits. These deficiencies are high priority because if a fire starts, lacking any of these tools can cripple the response. For instance, if an engine room fire occurred and all fire hoses were rotten, the crew would be helpless – definitely detainable. Score 8 – typically a ship will be detained if multiple essential firefighting appliances are unserviceable (e.g., all SCBA air bottles empty or out-of-test, no functional fire hoses on a deck).",8,Process
07111,Personal equipment,"SOLAS requires at least two fire-fighter’s outfits (complete gear: protective clothing, SCBA, spare air, helmet, boots, etc.). Often PSC finds issues: missing gloves, SCBA sets not holding pressure, or only one set on board. Given that without proper gear, crew can’t safely attack a fire, this is a detainable deficiency. In fact, “fireman’s outfit not complete” is very often on detention lists. PSC will make the ship get the missing kit before departure. Score 8. (No functional SCBA = immediate detention, as it imperils fire response).",8,Process
07112,Emergency escape breathing Device and disposition,"EEBDs (small air packs for escaping smoke-filled spaces) are required in machinery spaces and accommodations (quantity per crew size and layout). PSC checks their locations and expiration. If EEBDs are missing or not distributed per the Fire Plan (say, none in engine control room or too few in accommodations), that’s serious. In a smoke scenario, lack of EEBDs can lead to asphyxiation of crew trying to escape. PSC will require compliance (often detaining if all EEBDs in E/R are expired or if significantly undersupplied). We give 7.",7,Process
07113,Fire pumps and its pipes,"The main fire pumps (typically two engine-room pumps) and fire main piping must be capable of providing two powerful fire hoses. If one main fire pump is out of order and the other alone can’t meet demand (or if fire main piping is leaking such that pressure is low), the ship’s ability to fight even a small fire is compromised. PSC often tests fire pump pressure by having crew run hoses on deck. Insufficient pressure or inoperable pump = detention (unless emergency pump can cover, but that’s not for normal use). Many detentions cite “fire main incapable of delivering water to furthest hydrant.” Score 8 – high severity.",8,Process
07114,"Means of control (opening, pumps) Machinery spaces","This refers to remote shutoffs and controls to stop fuel pumps, ventilation fans, quick-closing valves on fuel lines, etc., from outside the space in case of a fire. If these don’t work (e.g., fuel quick-close valves are seized open, fan dampers don’t shut), then a machinery space fire cannot be starved of fuel or air – a dire situation that can lead to total loss. PSC places extreme importance on th8】; many detentions involve jammed quick-closing valves or vents that wouldn’t close. We score 9. A ship will typically be detained until, say, all quick-closing valves are overhauled and proven to shut, because a roaring engine room fire with fuel supply continuing is practically uncontrollable.",9,Process
07115,Fire-dampers,"Ventilation fire dampers in ducts must close to cut off airflow in a fire. PSC often finds dampers frozen due to rust or paint. Inability to close them means a fire, especially in engine room, will get constant oxygen and spread smoke throughout. It’s a serious deficiency; the crew is usually made to free up or replace dampers immediately. If many critical dampers are stuck, detention is likely. Score 8.",8,Process
07116,Ventilation,"This may refer to ventilation systems for spaces like galleys, paint lockers, etc., which might need fire dampers or fire-safe construction. For example, galley exhausts must be clean to prevent grease fires. PSC checks if ventilation systems themselves are not creating fire hazards (like an impromptu fan in a class A bulkhead without proper isolation). It’s moderately severe. For instance, a clogged galley vent flue is common and can lead to fire – PSC will demand cleaning but not detain unless it’s extreme.",6,Process
07117,Jacketed high pressure lines and oil leakage alarm,"(SOLAS II-2 Reg.4.2.2.5) Engines must have high-pressure fuel lines jacketed (to catch spray) and equipped with leak alarm systems because unjacketed high-pressure fuel sprays on hot surfaces have caused many engine room fires. If PSC finds missing spray shields on fuel pipes or inoperative oil mist/leak alarms, they see a ticking bomb. This is often a cause for detention or at least an MO (memorandum) requiring immediate f4】, because a single pinhole in an injector line could spray fuel that ignites. Score 9. PSC will insist all fuel line shields are in place and leak alarms functional before sailing.",9,Process
07118,International shore-connection,"A standard shore fire connection allows shore fire services to pump water into the ship’s fire main. If the coupling (usually a small flange piece) is missing, the ship can’t easily accept shore water. It’s a minor item (cheap to replace) and doesn’t affect shipboard firefighting capability at sea. PSC will just instruct to get one. Score 3.",3,Process
07120,Means of escape,"There must be two means of escape from engine rooms and other major spaces (typically two ladders, or a door plus an emergency escape hatch). If one is blocked or unusable, crew could be trapped by fire. PSC is very alert to locked or obstructed escape routes – e.g., an engine room escape trunk secured shut or used as storage is detainable under ISM/MLC (unsafe working conditions). They’ll demand immediate clearing. Many detentions cite “Means of escape not readily accessible” especially on cargo ships where e.g., a funnel door was locked. Score 8 – critical for crew survival in fire.",8,Process
07121,Crew alarm,"Perhaps refers to the general alarm (already covered by 08101) or a dedicated ""crew-only alarm"" on some ships. Possibly an alarm to wake off-duty crew for emergencies (in some UMS ships, engineer’s alarm). Since general alarm is separately listed, 07121 might not be common. If it meant the crew call alarm in machinery spaces, that’s more in 08105. So, likely a low-rated item or duplicate. We assign 5 for completeness.",5,Process
07122,Fire control plan,"(SOLAS II-2 Reg.15.2.4) The ship’s Fire Control Plan (diagram of fire stations, detectors, vents, etc.) must be posted and updated. If missing or outdated, shore firefighters and crew may lack critical info in an emergency. PSC typically checks it in port. If it’s not posted or reflects an old layout, they’ll require correction. It’s moderately important – likely not a detention cause alone, but definitely to be fixed before departure (some port states might delay sailing for it because it’s a SOLAS requirement to have one onboard).",6,Process
07123,Operation of Fire protection systems,"If PSC observes that crew cannot operate critical fire systems (e.g., they don’t know how to release the CO₂, or they fail to start the emergency fire pump promptl4】, that’s an operational readiness failure. This code suggests the crew’s handling of systems was unsatisfactory. It’s effectively an ISM failure and PSC will often detain for retraining if, say, engineers didn’t know how to activate machinery space CO₂ or use fixed foam on deck. Score 8 – because inability to operate systems renders them useless.",8,Process
07124,Maintenance of Fire protection systems,"PSC looks at maintenance records for things like annual servicer inspection of extinguishers, 2-yearly servicer check of SCBA air bottles, etc. If there is evidence of poor maintenance (e.g., last service dates long overdue, fire pump not overhauled in ages, detection system never serviced), they cite this as an ISM issue. It indicates other problems may lurk. Score 7 – while not an immediate physical defect itself, it correlates with actual deficiencies and is taken seriously under ISM.",7,Process
07125,Evaluation of crew performance (fire drills),"Similar to 04109 but explicitly referencing management’s evaluation of drills (an ISM element). PSC might use this to note that the company’s training regime failed because the crew’s fire drill performance was poor. It reinforces the seriousness of 04109; essentially an ISM-code catch for training shortcomings. Same severity (7) as we gave to fire drills, as it would typically accompany that deficiency.",7,Process
07199,Other (fire safety),"Any other fire safety issue. Could be, for example, a missing fire safety operational booklet, or an unusual situation like multiple small deficiencies combined. Fire safety “other” will generally be treated as important by PSC. Assigning moderately high severity by default, with actual handling depending on specifics.",7,Process
00008,Alarms,,,Equipment
08101,General alarm,"(SOLAS III) The general alarm must alert all crew/passengers of an emergency (audible throughout the ship). If it fails, crew might not muster in time. PSC often tests it; a nonfunctional general alarm is typically detainable (ship cannot sail with no general alarm) – it’s fundamental to emergency response. Workarounds (like shouting or portable alarms) are not acceptable long-term. Score 9.",9,Equipment
08102,Emergency signal,"This likely is the same as general alarm or the “ship’s whistle” (for abandon ship signal). In some contexts, “Emergency signal” could mean the sound signals (whistle) for muster. If the whistle or alarm for abandon ship is not working, it’s equally serious (crew/passengers won’t know when to abandon). So we also assign 9. (On passenger ships, different alarms for “crew alert” vs “passenger alert” exist – either way, failure is critical.)",9,Equipment
08103,Fire alarm,"This refers to the internal alarm that sounds when the automatic fire detection system triggers. If that audible alarm (e.g., bells/sirens in spaces) isn’t working, even if detectors sense a fire, people won’t be alerted to evacuate or fight it. The detection panel might show it, but crew in vicinity need the alarm sound. PSC would treat this similarly to general alarm – if parts of the fire alarm system don’t sound, they’ll likely detain until fixed or enforce a fire patrol. Score 8.",8,Equipment
08104,Steering-gear alarm,"On the bridge, an alarm should sound if the steering gear fails (e.g., lost hydraulic pressure or power). If this alarm is broken, a steering failure might go unnoticed until the ship doesn’t respond to helm – by then it could be in a dangerous situation. However, an attentive helmsman can notice loss of rudder control quickly even without the alarm. PSC will want it repaired but likely won’t detain if manual checks are in place (just require fix soon). Moderate importance.",5,Equipment
08105,Engineer's alarm,"In UMS (unattended engine room) operation, an alarm in engineers’ quarters (buzzer) sounds to alert engineers if something goes wrong at night. If it’s not working, an engineer might not wake up for an engine alarm – meaning a machinery failure or fire could escalate. PSC (especially USCG) cares about this: they might require the ship to revert to manned engine watches (no UMS) until fix6】. Not typically a detention if manning can compensate, but a significant inconvenience. Score 5.",5,Equipment
08106,Inert gas alarm,"Tankers have alarms for inert gas system failures (like low pressure or high oxygen in tank). If those alarms don’t function, the crew could be unaware that tanks are losing inert condition, risking an explosion. PSC treats inert gas issues with highest severity (as per code 07102). A faulty IG alarm will likely result in detention or at least a stop to cargo operations until fixed, because it’s integral to preventing tanker explosio2】. Score 8.",8,Equipment
08107,Machinery controls alarm,"This could mean alarms for machineries outside main engine, such as controllable pitch propeller failure, engine room monitoring system alarms in general. If the integrated machinery alarm console has issues, engineers might not be alerted to, say, lube oil pressure drop. If it’s UMS, see above engineer’s alarm; if manned, they have direct gauges too. PSC will require it fixed and possibly require manned operation in interim. Score 6.",6,Equipment
08108,UMS-alarms,"Specifically alarms required for Unattended Machinery Space operations (like all machinery faults, fire, flooding alarms that should annunciate in ECR and engineers’ quarters). If the central UMS alarm system is impaired, the ship effectively cannot operate in UMS mode safely. PSC will generally require it to revert to manned 24/7 watches (or detain in port if crew size inadequate for that) until alarm system is restor6】. Score 6.",6,Equipment
08109,Boiler-alarm,"Boilers have critical alarms (like low water level, high pressure) to prevent explosions. If a ship’s oil-fired auxiliary boiler’s safety alarms aren’t working, the boiler could over-pressurize or run dry and explode – extremely dangerous. PSC would likely detain or demand the boiler be shut down (which could impair operations if that boiler supplies steam for cargo pumps or heating). Boiler explosions are catastrophic, so we give 7 – definitely needs immediate repair or usage stoppage.",7,Equipment
08110,Closing watertight doors alarm,"Watertight doors (esp. on passenger ships) have an audible alarm that sounds before they shut (to warn people to clear the way). If this alarm fails, someone could be caught and crushed by a door closing remotely. This is more a personnel safety issue than ship survivability. PSC will note and require it fixed – moderate-low severity. (Some authorities might consider it MLC-related to crew safety.)",4,Equipment
08199,Other (alarms),"Any other alarm system not specifically listed (e.g., flood detection alarm in spaces, or cargo smoke alarms perhaps). Severity depends on what alarm it is. As a baseline, missing or broken alarms reduce safety margins, so moderate severity default. If it’s an alarm for a critical function, PSC will treat it as such (possibly detainable); if minor, then just require repair.",6,Equipment
00009,Working and Living Conditions - Living conditions,,,Process
09101,Minimum age,"(MLC A1.1) Seafarers under 16 (or under 18 for night work/hazardous duties) are generally prohibited. If PSC finds an underage crew member, it’s a serious violation of international labor standards – effectively illegal child labor. The vessel will be detained until the situation is resolved (e.g., underage person repatriate9】. Such cases are rare but treated very strictly. Score 8.",8,Process
09102,"Dirty, parasites","Living spaces must be clean and habitable. Infestation by rats, cockroaches, bedbugs (“parasites”) or extreme filth (rotten food, sewage spills in accommodation) poses health risks. PSC has detained ships for unsanitary accommodation on MLC grounds when conditions endanger crew health. If they find vermin or gross uncleanness, they will require professional cleaning/fumigati2】. We score 7 – besides health, it indicates neglect by company (possible ISM issues too).",7,Process
09103,Ventilation (Accommodation),"Crew quarters ventilation (air conditioning or fans) must be adequate. In tropics, lack of ventilation can cause heat stress; in cold, dampness/mold. If ventilation is not functioning or insufficient (e.g., blown AC and no other airflow), PSC will cite it. Under MLC, accommodation should be “adequately ventilated.” It’s moderate – usually not detainable unless it’s extreme and crew are suffering acute issues. They’ll urge repair of HVAC. Score 5.",5,Process
09104,Heating,"In colder climates, accommodations must have heating. If a ship in winter has no heating and crew quarters are very cold, that’s a deficiency (risk of illness). PSC will note and insist on fix (portable heaters or repair) before sailing in cold regions. If ship stays in tropical zones, heating is less an issue. So severity depends on context; average 4.",4,Process
09105,Noise,"Excessive noise in accommodation (engines, propeller, machinery noise) can cause long-term hearing damage and fatigue. MLC and IMO have guidelines on acceptable noise levels. Realistically, PSC doesn’t have noise meters typically, but could act if noise is obviously extreme (like crew cannot sleep due to noise). It’s minor in enforcement priority; they might suggest a class noise survey if crew complain. Low severity.",3,Process
09106,Sanitary facilities,"Sanitary facilities (toilets, showers, washbasins) must be in working order and adequate number. If toilets are all out of order or insufficient for crew, that’s both a health hazard and violation of MLC. PSC has detained ships where toilets were not functioning (e.g., all heads backed up) as it’s unsafe and undignified for cr2】. Score 6 – significant and must be fixed quickly (arrange shore use or repair).",6,Process
09107,Drainage,"Deck drains and internal drainage in accommodations (sinks, showers) should be functioning to remove waste water. If constantly clogged, living spaces can flood or breed bacteria. Not usually a detention item unless it’s causing unsanitary conditions. PSC will note and require plumbing fixes. Low-moderate.",4,Process
09108,Lighting (Accommodation),"Adequate lighting in cabins and messes is required (for comfort and to avoid accidents). If many lights are out and it’s very dim, it violates habitability standards. Easy to fix (change bulbs). Minor severity.",4,Process
09109,"Pipes, wires (insulation)","Exposed hot pipes or uninsulated wiring in living areas pose burns or electrical shock risks. For example, a steam pipe running through a cabin without lagging can burn crew; exposed electrical wires can electrocute or spark a fire. PSC takes safety hazards to crew seriously – these would violate MLC “safe accommodations” and possibly SOLAS (electrical standards). They’ll require insulation and proper enclosures immediately. Score 6.",6,Process
09110,Electrical devices,"This could refer to unsafe personal electrical appliances or ship-provided devices in cabins (improper adapters, space heaters causing fire hazard). If PSC sees, e.g., jury-rigged wiring to a hot plate in a cabin, they’ll cite it and likely have it removed. It’s moderate – addresses potential fire sources in living quarters.",5,Process
09111,Sickbay,"Ships with >15 crew on long voyages must have a dedicated hospital/sickbay. If required and not present (or converted to other use), or if the sickbay is unhygienic/unusable, that’s an MLC violation. PSC will score it moderate – important for crew healthcare but not urgent unless someone is currently ill and can’t be cared for.",5,Process
09112,Medical equipment,"The medical locker must contain medicines and first aid equipment as per IMO’s Medical First Aid Guide / flag requirements. If essential medicines are missing or expired (e.g., no antibiotics, no pain meds, no sutures), crew life could be at risk in emergencies with no treatment. PSC often checks the medicine inventory against the required list. A serious lack (say nothing to treat injuries, no stretcher) can lead to detention under MLC until restock2】. Score 7.",7,Process
09113,Access/structure,"Safe structural access in accommodation – for instance, stairs must have handrails, doors not dangerously low height (leading to head injuries). If PSC finds something like a ladder to bridge with broken rungs or a missing railing on a high catwalk in accommodation, they’ll cite it as unsafe. Needs quick fixing. Moderate.",5,Process
09114,Sleeping room,"Standards for crew bedrooms (size, number of occupants per cabin). If, say, more people are crammed in a cabin than allowed or room is too small per MLC, it’s a deficiency. Also, basic amenities (mattress, bedding) must be provided. PSC will note and require compliance (like reduce occupancy or refit cabin). Not immediately dangerous but affects welfare. Moderate-low.",4,Process
09115,No direct openings into sleeping rooms cargo/mach.,"MLC and ILO conventions forbid that living quarters open directly into cargo spaces or machinery spaces (to avoid fumes, noise). If PSC finds a cabin door that opens into, say, a cargo hold or engine room (perhaps on a retrofitted ship), that’s a serious design flaw. It can expose crew to hazardous atmosphere (e.g., cargo vapors leaking in). They would likely detain until that opening is sealed or cabin relocated, because it’s a direct threat to crew health. Score 8.",8,Process
09116,Furnishings,"Crew cabins must have adequate furniture (bed, desk, locker). If furnishings are missing or in disrepair (no locker for clothes, etc.), it’s a minor MLC non-compliance. PSC will require providing those but it’s low severity.",3,Process
09117,"Berth dimensions, etc.","Bunk size and arrangement must meet minimums. If bunks are too small or stacked more than 2 high without special exemption, it’s a technical violation. Not likely to cause detention; PSC notes it and owners eventually must rectify (especially on older ships that might not fully comply). Low severity.",3,Process
09118,Clear head,"Accommodation headroom must be at least a certain height (e.g., 2 meters in cabins per MLC). If some areas have less (older ships might have narrow headroom), it’s a minor deficiency unless it’s egregious (crew constantly hitting heads). PSC usually would not detain for this on existing ships – it might be grandfathered or need addressing at next refit. Very low severity.",2,Process
09119,Messroom (location),"The mess and recreational facilities should be located away from work areas (not in engine room, etc.). If the design is odd, PSC might note it, but unless it clearly violates MLC guidelines, it’s minor.",2,Process
09120,Oil skin locker,"There should be a place (drying locker) for wet work clothing (oilskins) outside of sleeping rooms. If not provided, crew might have to dry wet gear in cabins, causing dampness. Minor issue; PSC might mention it if missing, but not a detention item.",2,Process
09121,Laundry,"Crew must have access to laundry facilities (washing machine, etc.). If none or inadequate (say 20 crew and a single domestic washer that’s broken), it’s an inconvenience but also hygiene issue long-term. PSC will note it – moderate-low severity; requires fix but not urgent.",3,Process
09122,Record of inspection (Accommodation),"MLC requires the master or designated officer to inspect accommodation and catering facilities regularly (often weekly) and record the inspections. If no records, it suggests the ship isn’t monitoring living conditions. PSC will cite the lack of documentation (and possibly scrutinize conditions more). It’s a procedural MLC issue – moderate-low severity itself.",3,Process
09124,"Galley, handlingroom (maintenance)","(Note: Code jump from .22 to .24 implies some codes reserved .23). The galley and food handling areas must be clean and well-maintained. PSC frequently checks for galley cleanliness, functioning cooking equipment, proper food storage (e.g., no flaking paint above food prep areas). If the galley is filthy or equipment like stoves or fridges are broken, it can cause food-borne illness or fire. They’ll require immediate deep cleaning or equipment repair. Score 5 – important for crew health; serious deficiencies here can contribute to MLC detentions if food safety is at risk.",5,Process
09127,Cleanliness,"General cleanliness of accommodation and galley. If living spaces are very dirty (beyond just untidy – e.g., mold growth, garbage not emptied, floors grimy), that’s a health hazard and reflects poor management.

09128,Provisions quantity,"(MLC Reg.3.2) Adequate food stores for voyage must be on board. If PSC calculates or observes that provisions are insufficient for number of crew and duration (or crew complain of food shortages), it’s detainable under MLC. Cases have occurred where PSC held ships in port until they took more food because starving crew is obviously unacceptable. Score 8 – directly affects crew survival and morale.",8,Process
09129,Provisions quality,"Food quality (not spoiled, good nutritional value) is as important as quantity. If PSC finds spoiled meat in the freezer, perished vegetables, or crew raise issues of sub-standard food (e.g., insect-infested rice), they will act. They may detain or give the ship a short deadline to load fresh supplies before saili2】. This is high severity on welfare grounds – bad food can cause sickness and violates MLC.",8,Process

If mooring decks are dark due to failed lights, PSC will note it. This is relatively simple to fix (replace deck light bulbs). They might delay night-time sailing until lighting is fixed or provide temporary lights. Moderate.",5,Process
09232,Cleanliness of engine room,"(ISM Code/Oil pollution) A dirty, oil-soaked engine room is a fire and pollution hazard. PSC and USCG frequently detain ships for excessive oil in engine roo4】 – pooled oil in bilges or soaked lagging can ignite, and also often indicates illegal pumping overboard if not properly disposed. If an engine room is very grimy with oil, PSC presumes poor maintenance and possible non-compliance with MARPOL (like bypassing the OWS). Detentions are common under both fire safety and pollution prevention grounds. Score 9 – it’s one of the more common serious deficiencies leading to detention (requiring immediate cleanup and fixing leaks).",9,Process
09233,Guards / fencing around dangerous machinery parts,"(Similar to 09208/09218) If dangerous areas like rotating equipment aren’t fenced off or guarded to prevent crew entering hazard zones, it’s unsafe. Think of an unfenced opening to moving machinery. PSC expects such areas to have physical barriers. If not, they will cite it. It’s moderate-high in that it should be fixed but is often straightforward (install a railing, etc.).",6,Process
09234,Night working for seafarer under the age of 18,"(MLC A1.1) Seafarers under 18 should not work at night (exceptions apply for training). If PSC finds a 17-year-old cadet is put on night watch routinely, that violates MLC. It’s a labor rights issue; they’ll cite it and require ending that practice immediately. Possibly a deficiency to be rectified by reassigning hours. Score 6 – significant for that individual’s rights and rest.",6,Process
09235,Fitness for duty - work and rest hours,"(STCW Section A-VIII/1 & MLC A2.3) Compliance with rest hour regulations is critical to prevent fatigue (implicated in many accidents). If PSC finds chronic violations of work/rest hours (via logbooks or crew interviews), it’s a serious issue. Multiple port states (especially in Paris MoU) detain ships for extensive rest hour non-compliance, as fatigued crew endanger safe navigati7】. This is often treated as an ISM failure. Score 8 – high because fatigue can directly cause collisions/groundings. PSC will demand manning changes or schedule changes to comply before departure.",8,Process
09236,Legal documentation on work and rest hours,"If the vessel isn’t properly recording work/rest hours (or records are obviously falsified – e.g., every entry 08-16 work, 16-00 rest with no variation), PSC will note it. It could imply crew are exceeding limits and doctoring logs. The act of missing or fudging records is moderate severity itself (a compliance issue), but it strongly hints at 09235 issues (fatigue), which are severe. Alone, 5; but usually coupled with 09235.",5,Process
09237,Fitness for duty - intoxication,"(STCW Code V) If PSC observes or has evidence that a crew member, especially a watchkeeper, is intoxicated by alcohol or drugs while on duty, it’s an immediate detention scenario. SOLAS V/BRM principles and many national laws forbid watchkeeping under influence. There have been casualties (Exxon Valdez, etc.) tied to intoxication. PSC will remove the person from duty and likely detain the vessel until a sober replacement is found or the crew is manag3】. This is essentially a zero-tolerance area. Score 10 – poses immediate extreme risk to safe navigation.",10,Process
09297,Other (working space ILO),"Any other working condition issue per ILO/MLC not listed (maybe ergonomic issues, or lack of proper lifting equipment forcing unsafe manual lifts). Typically moderate.",5,Process
09298,Other (accident prevention),"Other miscellaneous safety precautions (could overlap ISM; e.g., no safety committee, or no risk assessments being done). Moderate default.",5,Process
09299,Other (mooring),"Any mooring-related safety issue not captured (maybe lack of identified snap-back zones, or poor lead of ropes). Mooring is high-risk, so we give 6 by default – actual severity depends on the specific issue but mooring practices are under scrutiny due to many crew injuries.",6,Process
00010,Safety of Navigation,,,Process
10101,Pilot ladders and hoist/pilot transfer arrangements,"(SOLAS V/Reg.23 & IMO Res.) The arrangement to embark/disembark pilots (pilot ladder, accommodation ladder combination, pilot hoist if used) must meet strict standards. If it’s unsafe (defective steps, improper rigging, manropes missing), pilots can refuse to board and PSC will detain or delay the ship until corrected. Many pilot fatalities have occurred due to improper ladders, so this is high priority. PSC often inspects pilot ladders before departure; a non-compliant ladder (e.g., worn steps) is usually detainable until replaced. Score 8.",8,Process
10102,Type approval equipment,"All mandatory nav equipment (radar, gyro, ECDIS, etc.) must be of approved types meeting IMO performance standards. If the ship installed a non-approved gadget (say a commercial GPS not type-approved for SOLAS), PSC will note it. The equipment might function, but not being approved is a compliance issue. They’ll likely require eventual replacement with approved unit. Low severity short-term (as long as it works), but the ship is technically in violation.",4,Process
10103,Radar,"(SOLAS V) At least one (usually two) functioning radars are required. If both radars are non-operational, the ship is effectively “blind” to other vessels – a clear detention. Even one radar failure is serious, though if the second radar works, they might allow sailing to next port for repair (with increased caution). Given collisions often result from lack of radar plotting, PSC is strict. Score 9 – no ship should sail in restricted visibility or traffic without radar. (Often if one of two radars is out, deficiency is given Code 17 to fix before departure or at next port latest.)",9,Process
10104,Gyro compass,"(SOLAS V) The gyrocompass provides stable heading information to the bridge and to auto-pilot, radar displays, etc. If it fails, the ship must rely on magnetic compass which is less precise and cannot feed autopilot or ARPA effectively. Many ships have two gyros; if one fails but other works, that’s a deficiency but not an immediate danger. If no gyro at all, that’s detainable especially in coastal/traffic areas (the ship would lose ARPA target tracking and steering precision). Score 8 – crucial for navigation. PSC often requires at least one operational gyro and evidence the second will be fixed quickly.",8,Process
10105,Magnetic compass,"(SOLAS V) The magnetic compass (with deviation card) is a backup to gyro. If the magnetic compass is not operational (e.g., liquid leaked out or frozen) or no deviation table available, that’s a deficiency. If the gyro is healthy, it’s not an immediate hazard, but still the only emergency heading reference if power is lost. PSC will usually require it be repaired/calibrated at the next port (not usually detainable if gyro works, except maybe in high latitude where gyro is less reliable). Score 6.",6,Process
10106,Compass correction log,"Vessels must log compass deviations and adjustments. If the compass has not been swung for deviation recently or no deviation card is present, accuracy is uncertain. PSC will note this – minor issue unless the magnetic compass is the only compass and uncorrected (then it’s more serious). Typically low severity.",3,Process
10107,Automatic radar plotting aid (ARPA),"SOLAS requires vessels of certain size to have ARPA or other means for collision plotting. If the radar is functioning but ARPA feature is inoperative, the bridge can still use manual plotting or other aids, but it increases workload and possibility of error. PSC will cite an inoperable ARPA and likely require repair. But if at least one radar with ARPA works, they won’t detain for a second radar’s ARPA issue alone. Moderate severity. (If no ARPA at all on a ship that must have it, that’s more serious – likely code 17 to fix before departure or in port if in busy waters.)",5,Process
10109,"Lights, shapes, sound-signals","(COLREGs) The ship’s navigation lights (running lights, anchor lights), day shapes (like anchor ball, etc.), and sound signaling apparatus (ship’s whistle, bell) must be correct and operational. If running lights are not working properly, the ship is virtually invisible or conveys wrong status at night – a huge collision risk. PSC often tests nav lights; a failed light (say stern light out) is often grounds for detention until fixed or at least must be fixed by nightfa1】. Sound signal failure (e.g., whistle not sounding) also very serious in fog. Score 9 – collision avoidance basics. A ship will not be allowed to sail until nav lights and whistle are in full order (in some ports, they might let it go in daytime to next port if weather clear, but it’s typically expedite-fix in port).",9,Process
10110,Signalling lamp,"SOLAS requires an Morse signal lamp on bridge (with spare bulbs) for visual communications. If it’s missing or not working, it’s a minor issue in modern times (rarely used except maybe naval convoys or as backup). PSC will note it but it’s low severity – just replace the bulb or lamp.",3,Process
10111,Charts,"(SOLAS V) The ship must carry all up-to-date nautical charts for the intended voyage (or have an approved ECDIS). Not having proper charts is one of the most frequent detention causes historically – because navigating without correct charts is extremely dangero4】. PSC will check paper chart folios or ECDIS ENC permits. Missing critical charts or using outdated ones (not corrected for latest notices) is grounds for immediate detention. For example, if sailing to a port and no large-scale approach chart on board, the ship cannot safely navigate there. Score 10. (With ECDIS, if official ENCs for the route are not available or not used, same severity – detention until proper electronic charts installed.)",10,Process
10112,Electronic charts (ECDIS),"If the ship is required to have ECDIS and it’s not functional or not updated with current ENCs, that’s very serious. Many detentions involve ECDIS issues nowadays (e.g., using expired ENC licenses, or the officers not trained on ECDIS). If ECDIS is primary means and it fails, the ship must either have adequate paper charts as backup or fix the ECDIS. PSC will detain if neither proper paper backup nor ECDIS is available. Score 9. Even if paper charts are on board (optional backup on some ships), an inoperable mandated ECDIS is a major deficiency to be fixed promptly.",9,Process
10113,Automatic Identification System (AIS),"(SOLAS V) AIS transmits the ship’s identity and position to others and shore. If AIS is not working, vessels in vicinity or VTS lose a key collision avoidance tool, and in some areas it’s illegal to sail without AIS. PSC will often not let a ship sail through busy waters or particularly US/Europe will fine or detain for AIS off. Score 7 – important for safety/security. A short-term allowance might be given (like “sail directly to repair port in open ocean and fix AIS”) but generally must be restored ASAP.",7,Process
10114,Voyage Data Recorder (VDR) / Simplified Voyage Data Recorder (S-VDR),"(SOLAS V) VDR is the “black box” that records navigation data and bridge audio for incident investigation. If not working, it doesn’t directly affect current voyage safety – it’s for after-the-fact analysis. However, it’s required equipment. PSC will give a deficiency and typically require it fixed within 30 days or before next voyage (some flag States allow a single voyage with it inoperative if reported). Not usually detainable on the spot, but must be resolved. Score 6 (important for investigation, but not a real-time safety device).",6,Process
10115,GNSS receiver/terrestrial radio navigation system,"(SOLAS V) The ship needs a positioning system (nowadays GPS or other Global Navigation Satellite System). If GPS is completely down and no backup like LORAN (which is rare now) or even celestial nav proficiency, the ship can’t safely navigate beyond visual references. PSC will likely detain a vessel without any working electronic position-fixing ability, especially in coastal waters. Score 7 – critical equipment. (If one of two GPS is down, not as severe, but at least one must work).",7,Process
10116,Nautical publications,"Publications like Sailing Directions, Tide Tables, List of Lights, Notice to Mariners, etc., must be on board and updated. If some are missing or very outdated, it’s a deficiency. E.g., not having current Tide Tables for a port with big tides can be dangerous. PSC will require obtaining the missing pubs (often available in digital form nowadays). Score 5 – navigationally important but easier to mitigate by getting info by other means in short term, so moderate.",5,Process
10117,Echo sounder,"(SOLAS V) The echo sounder provides depth under keel. If it’s not operational, the ship can’t detect shoaling in uncharted or dynamic seabeds and risks grounding. In confined or shallow routes, that’s extremely risky. PSC will consider detaining or at least requiring single voyage permission with extreme caution if an echo sounder is down. Typically must be repaired promptly. Score 7.",7,Process
10118,Speed and distance indicator,"A ship’s speed log (through-water or over-ground) is useful for navigation (especially for true water speed in currents, and for auto-slip control on CPP, etc.). If it’s broken, the ship can still estimate speed via GPS (speed over ground) and propulsion settings. It’s a minor deficiency; PSC will note it but likely not detain for just a log failure. Score 4.",4,Process
10119,Rudder angle indicator,"Displays the rudder angle on bridge. If not working, the helmsman cannot confirm rudder response except by feel or visually looking aft (impractical). In pilotage or precise maneuvering, that’s dangerous. If it fails during a PSC observed maneuver or test, they will insist on repair. Possibly not detain if in open ocean transit, but definitely before next port arrival it should be fixed. Score 6.",6,Process
10120,Revolution counter,"Shows propeller or engine RPM on bridge. If it’s out, the bridge might not precisely know engine output (though they have telegraph orders and feedback from ECR). Workaround: bridge can communicate with engine room for RPM info. Not critical for safety in most cases, though docking maneuvers benefit from it. PSC will note and require fixing but it’s low severity.",4,Process
10121,Variable pitch indicator,"For ships with CPP, bridge needs to know the blade pitch set. If that indicator fails, it’s difficult to judge propulsion output (they could infer from engine load or by trial). This is moderately important, especially for close-quarters handling. PSC would treat it similar to RPM indicator – need to fix, but ship can navigate with caution in interim. Score 5.",5,Process
10122,Rate-of-turn indicator,"Indicates how fast the ship is turning (yaw rate). Useful for pilots and in narrow channels. Not strictly required outside certain vessels. If it’s broken, navigator can manage by visual and compass cue, but it removes a helpful instrument. PSC will cite it but not detain solely for this if everything else is okay. Low severity.",4,Process
10123,International code of signals- SOLAS,"The code flags and signal reference for sending messages (like two-flag codes for medical, etc.). Must be carried (usually as a book). If missing, minor – seldom used nowadays due to radio, but required. PSC will instruct to obtain it.",2,Process
10124,Life-saving signals,"A poster or book of life-saving signals (signals between ship and rescue units) must be on bridge. If absent, minor (only used during SAR; rescuers usually know them). PSC notes it, low severity.",2,Process
10125,Use of the automatic pilot,"Possibly ensuring there are procedures posted or crew knowledge for switching between hand steering and autopilot (and warning about limitations of autopilot in heavy traffic). Some SOLAS guidance requires a notice on bridge “Automatic pilot shall be turned off in areas of high traffic”. If not posted or crew unaware, PSC might give a mild deficiency (bridge team management). Low severity.",3,Process
10126,Records of drills and steering gear tests,"SOLAS V requires testing steering gear within 12h before departure and logging it, as well as regular emergency steering drills. If PSC finds no record of pre-departure steering tests or that steering drills aren’t logged, it’s a procedural lapse. Given how critical steering failures are, PSC takes it seriously from an ISM perspective (ensuring the crew actually tests steering). They will cite it and likely verify a steering test while they are on board. Moderate severity (lack of compliance could lead to undetected steering problems).",4,Process
10127,Voyage or passage plan,"(SOLAS V Rule 34) Before each voyage, the bridge must prepare a berth-to-berth passage plan (considering shallow areas, no-go zones). If PSC asks for the voyage plan and the OOW can’t produce it (or it’s extremely inadequate), that’s a navigation safety gap and an ISM failure in bridge procedures. Many PSC regimes will detain or at least strongly admonish a vessel without a proper passage plan in pilotage waters (especially after Cosco Busan and other incidents). Score 5 – easy to fix (make a plan), but absence indicates poor safety culture.",5,Process
10128,Navigation bridge visibility,"SOLAS V prescribes minimum bridge visibility (forward of bow not obscured >2 ship lengths, etc.). If deck cargo or structural elements violate these limits, the ship is technically unseaworthy in that regard. PSC and port state control (like Canadian authorities) have delayed ships that arrived with visibility impeded (e.g., stacked containers too high blocking view). If, for example, a bulk carrier’s deck crane stowed position seriously blocks forward view and no alternative conning position exists, PSC would require correction (like adjusting cargo stow or use of a camera system) or restrict operations (must sail in daylight only). Score 7 – directly affects safe navigation.",7,Process
10129,Navigation records,"Navigation activities must be recorded (position in logbook, courses, etc.). If logkeeping is poor or records like echo sounder readings in restricted waters are not kept, PSC will note it as an ISM deficiency. Not immediately dangerous by itself, but reflects on bridge team discipline. Low severity, though could support a detention if combined with major nav failures.",3,Process
10132,Communication - SOLAS Chapter V,"This is vague; possibly means the requirements for internal communications relevant to navigation (like nav warnings reception or GMDSS – but those have their own codes). Could be used if, e.g., bridge and engine room communications are substandard (no sound-powered phone working and no backup). If bridge-to-engine comm fails (telegraph and phone both dead), that’s extremely serious for maneuvering – likely detainable under this code. Or if navtex not working (which we did under MSI code). It depends. Generally moderate, but specific issues could elevate it.",5,Process
10133,Bridge operation,"A general code possibly used if PSC observes inadequate bridge team management or procedures (like no one monitoring radar in dense traffic, or voyage plan not being followed). It might be cited as an ISM issue (“navigation procedures not followed”). Could arise from a navigation audit by PSC (e.g., during a concentrated inspection campaign). Score 6 – important for safety, though hard for PSC to judge unless something blatant occurs while they’re on the bridge.",6,Process
10134,HSC operation,"High-Speed Craft have special operational requirements (crew training, operational restrictions). If a high-speed ferry is not operating per its permit (say exceeding wave height limits, or crew not HSC certified), PSC will detain it as HSC incidents are high risk. Also, HSC Code requires specific manuals and drills. Score 7 – significant due to high consequences of HSC accidents.",7,Process
10135,Monitoring of voyage or passage plan,"It’s not enough to make a passage plan; the bridge must monitor it (position checks, etc.). If PSC finds officers are not routinely plotting positions or failed to adjust the plan when needed, they might cite this. It’s an ISM-related issue. For instance, after an incident, PSC might list that voyage plan wasn’t updated or monitored. Score 5 – moderate (this often comes out in accident investigations more than PSC inspections).",5,Process
10136,Establishment of working language on board,"SOLAS V/14 mandates a common working language for bridge team and crew, and it should be recorded (often in the log or posted). If crew have no agreed common language, it can cause miscommunication. PSC will check documentation (often “working language: English” posted on bridge). If not posted or crew seem confused, they’ll note it. Low severity (easily clarified).",3,Process
10137,Long-Range Identification and Tracking system (LRIT),"Ships must have LRIT transmitter (sends periodic position to flag/Coastal States via satellite). If it’s not working or not conformance-tested, it’s a security compliance issue (since authorities use it to track ships beyond AIS range). PSC might not detain solely for LRIT, but flag State could invalidate certificates if non-compliant. Some port States (like US) may restrict entry if LRIT off (they use it to monitor approaching ships). Score 4 – mainly an administrative/security issue, not directly safety-critical for the ship itself.",4,Process
10138,Bridge Navigational Watch Alarm System (BNWAS),"(SOLAS V Reg.19) BNWAS (an alarm that ensures the OOW is alert by requiring periodic reset, otherwise it alarms to summon another crew) is required on most ships now. If BNWAS is not fitted or not working, a lone watchkeeper could fall asleep with no alarm – a known cause of groundings. PSC will strongly insist on a functioning BNWAS; many detentions post-2015 include BNWAS not operational (as it is a SOLAS requirement). Score 7 – very important for preventing fatigue-related accidents (basically a safety net if OOW is incapacitated).",7,Process
10199,Other (navigation),"Any other navigational safety issue not covered (perhaps unusual equipment like steering gear backup controls, or ECDIS backup arrangement, etc.). Severity default moderate unless it’s something critical.",6,Process
00011,Life saving appliances,,,Equipment
11101,Lifeboats,"SOLAS requires sufficient, functional lifeboats. If a lifeboat cannot be launched or its engine won’t start, the ship is unseaworthy. PSC will detain the vessel immediately for serious lifeboat deficienci4】. Examples: a holed lifeboat hull, jammed release gear, or a non-starting lifeboat engine each score 10 – in an abandonment, that could cost lives. This is one of the most critical items; in fact, lifeboat issues were the single most common detainable deficiency code in recent data (319 detentions attribute4】.",10,Equipment
11102,Lifeboat inventory,"Lifeboats must carry a specific inventory (flares, food rations, water, first aid kit, compass, etc.). If some items are missing or expired (common: expired pyrotechnics or old food packs), it’s a deficiency. While a lifeboat would still float, lacking these reduces survival time. PSC will require replenishment before sailing – moderately severe because it’s easily fixable by restocking, but important for prolonged survival.",6,Equipment
11103,Stowage and provision of lifeboats,"Lifeboats must be correctly stowed (secured in davits or cradles, covers in place) and of required number/capacity. If, say, a lifeboat is not properly secured and could shift or fall, or if an obstruction prevents it from launching, it’s very serious. Also, each side must have sufficient capacity for all on board. PSC often checks that boat tracks are clear, lashings release quickly, etc. Any impairment in launching arrangements or insufficient capacity is detainable. Score 8.",8,Equipment
11104,Rescue boats,"A rescue boat (which may be one of the lifeboats or a dedicated RIB) must be readily deployable for man overboard rescue. If the rescue boat engine doesn’t start, or the boat is damaged, the ship effectively has no means to recover a person in the water. PSC nearly always detains ships for an inoperable rescue boat until fixed – this is a critical SOLAS requirement. Score 9.",9,Equipment
11105,Rescue boat inventory,"Similar to lifeboats: the rescue boat should have certain equipment (e.g., buoyant rescue sling, boat-hook, VHF, etc.). Missing inventory in a rescue boat (like no heaving line or quoit) is a deficiency but lower severity – the primary thing is the boat itself works. PSC will require the items to be supplied but not detain if that’s the sole issue and can be rectified quickly.",5,Equipment
11106,Fast rescue boats,"Some vessels (e.g., passenger ships, offshore vessels) have Fast Rescue Boats (FRB) with special launching systems. If an FRB is required and is not operational (engine failure or launch davit failure), it’s serious – especially on passenger ships where an FRB is key for quick recovery of people. PSC will likely detain passenger ships for an FRB fault until repaired or substitute measures in place, as it compromises rescue capability. Score 8.",8,Equipment
11107,Stowage of rescue boats,"Rescue boats must be in a position to be launched quickly (typically under 5 minutes). If the rescue boat is stowed improperly or its securing arrangement can’t be easily released, that’s a hazard (delayed MOB response). PSC will require adjustments (like removing extra lashings or cargo that blocks it). Not having clear access can lead to detention as well. Score 7.",7,Equipment
11108,Inflatable liferafts,"Ships carry inflatable liferafts (with Hydrostatic Release Units for float-free deployment). If rafts are in bad shape (out of service date, HRU expired, or inadequate capacity for crew count), that’s very severe. Should the ship need to abandon and lifeboats are inaccessible (common in rapid sinking), liferafts are last resort – they must inflate properly. PSC detains ships for expired or insufficient liferafts regularly. Score 9.",9,Equipment
11109,Rigid liferafts,"Rigid liferafts (now uncommon except on some older ships or special vessels) also must be in good condition. If present and unservicable (cracks, etc.), similar severity to inflatable rafts – critical backup survival craft. Score 9.",9,Equipment
11110,Stowage of liferafts,"Liferafts must be stowed such that they float free if the ship sinks (HRU connected, lashings weak link, etc.) or easily manually launched. If PSC sees rafts lashed down tight with no HRU, or obstructed by cargo, they’ll likely detain the ship until corrected because those rafts might not deploy in an emergency. Score 8.",8,Equipment
11111,Marine evacuation system,"Large passenger ships use MES (slides/rafts system) for mass evacuation. If the MES is not ready for use (e.g., slide defects, rafts not connected, recent failed drill), the ferry or cruise ship cannot safely evacuate passengers. PSC will detain a passenger vessel if the MES isn’t functional, as there’s no alternative for rapid evacuation of hundreds of people. Score 9.",9,Equipment
11112,Launching arrangements for survival craft,"Davits, winches, release hooks, etc., for lifeboats/rafts must work flawlessly. If a lifeboat davit or hook is faulty, that is often an immediate detenti7】 – many lives depend on it. PSC inspectors frequently watch a drill: if the boat gets stuck or hooks won’t release, the system is considered failed. They will not allow sailing until repaired (often requiring manufacturer service). Because a failure here in real abandon could be fatal (lifeboat not launching or falling prematurely), severity is 10. (This includes the infamous on-load release gear failures; PSC is extremely strict after many accidents in drills).",10,Equipment
11113,Launching arrangements for rescue boats,"Similar to above but for the rescue boat’s davit or crane. If the rescue boat cannot be safely launched and recovered, the ship’s ability to conduct SAR for MOB is nil. Likely detention until fixed. Score 9.",9,Equipment
11114,Helicopter landing and pick-up area,"Some ships (e.g., large passenger or research ships) have a heli deck or winching area for rescue or transfer. If required by Flag and it’s not per standard (markings faded, obstructions), it’s a deficiency. It may not halt a voyage unless in regions where helicopter evacuation is expected (Arctic, etc.), but it must be rectified for compliance. Moderate (6).",6,Equipment
11115,Means of rescue,"Every ship should have means to recover a person from water (e.g., a scramble net, Jason’s cradle, or dedicated davit). If PSC finds no practical means (especially if freeboard is high), they will cite this. It’s required by SOLAS III Regulation 17 since 2014. Lack of a plan or equipment for MOB recovery is serious – they’ll demand one be implemented (e.g., rig an overside ladder or device before departure). Score 7.",7,Equipment
11116,Distress flares,"Ships must carry pyrotechnic distress signals (red hand flares, parachute rockets, smoke signals). If these are missing or expired, the ship’s ability to signal distress is compromised. PSC usually checks their expiry dates. If all are long expired, it’s fairly severe (though with GMDSS, flares are backup). They’ll require new ones be obtained before sailing. Score 6.",6,Equipment
11117,Lifebuoys incl. provision and disposition,"The ship must have the required number of lifebuoys (with self-igniting lights, smoke for the bridge one, and a buoyant line on at least one). If any are missing, damaged, or not equipped with light/smoke as required, that’s a direct MOB rescue impairment. PSC often counts lifebuoys and finds maybe one or two short (fallen overboard en route and not replaced). They will require immediate replacement (many ports will detain a ship until critical LSA like lifebuoys are replaced, which can often be done same day). Score 7 – each lifebuoy can save a life, so missing ones are taken seriously.",7,Equipment
11118,Lifejackets incl. provision and disposition,"There must be lifejackets for every person on board + spares (and special sizes for children if passengers). If any shortfall in quantity, or if lifejackets are not readily accessible (e.g., locked away, or heavily waterlogged/decayed), that’s an immediate detention typically. Not having a serviceable lifejacket for someone virtually condemns them in an abandon ship scenario. PSC also checks lights on lifejackets; if all those lights are dead, it’s a deficiency (lesser than missing jackets, but still important to fix for night rescue). We assign 9 – it directly affects survivability and is one of the most basic LSA requirements.",9,Equipment
11119,Immersion suits,"(SOLAS III Reg.32.3) For ships trading in cold waters, immersion suits (thermal protective suits) are required for all crew. If suits are missing, not enough for everyone, or unwearable (zipper broken, etc.), crew could die of hypothermia after abandoning ship. PSC in cold regions will detain ships lacking proper immersion suits until rectified (they often inspect a random suit for damage or size). Score 8. (In moderate climates if not required, no issue, but PSC uses this code often in cold area inspections.)",8,Equipment
11120,Anti-exposure suits,"These are lighter exposure suits required typically for rescue boat crew or pilots (for use when a work requires going into water in less cold climates). If required and missing, the rescue boat crew might not be protected in cold waters. It’s a moderate deficiency – relevant mainly on some passenger and offshore vessels. PSC will ensure the ship has them if needed. Score 6.",6,Equipment
11121,Thermal Protective Aids,"TPAs are like thermal foil bags provided in liferafts for use by survivors to prevent hypothermia. Each liferaft should have a number of TPAs. If missing, the raft occupants might not last as long in cold conditions. PSC will note missing TPAs (or expired ones) but this alone usually isn’t detainable – they will ensure replacements are obtained. Score 5.",5,Equipment
11122,Radio life-saving appliances,"Ships must carry at least 2 two-way VHF handheld radios for survival craft to communicate with each other and rescuers. If these are missing or not working (batteries dead), survivors in lifeboats can’t coordinate or signal SAR units. PSC frequently checks these during drills. Missing two-way radios is fairly serious – they will typically insist on obtaining replacements or new batteries immediately (before sailing). Score 7.",7,Equipment
11123,Emergency equipment for 2-way comm.,"Possibly related to on-scene communications for large passenger ships (many portable radios for crew coordination). Not entirely clear, could be duplicative of 11122 or refer to GMDSS handhelds. If it’s referencing passenger ship crew’s portable radios for internal communication during emergency (as required by Safe Return to Port regulations), missing ones would be noted. We’ll score 5 as moderate – context-dependent.",5,Equipment
11124,Embarkation arrangement survival craft,"This refers to the setup for crew/passengers to safely board lifeboats or liferafts: embarkation ladders, platforms, illumination at embarkation stations. If something is unsafe (e.g., no embarkation ladder for rafts so crew would have to jump, or ladder is damaged, or lights not working), PSC will cite it. In passenger ships, poorly arranged mustering/embarkation is detainable as it hinders evacuation. Score 7.",7,Equipment
11125,Embarkation arrangements rescue boats,"Ensuring crew can safely board the rescue boat for launch (like a proper access platform or ladder to the boat when stowed). If not, there is risk of a crewman falling while trying to enter the rescue boat during deployment. PSC would require improvement (maybe railing or a step installed). Moderate.",6,Equipment
11126,Means of recovery of life saving appliances,"Possibly about recovering lifeboats/rescue boats (e.g., ship must have a way to retrieve boats after a drill or after deployment). If a ship cannot recover its rescue boat (no davit recovery method working), that’s an issue but secondary to launching. Or it could mean retrieving a liferaft from water (some ships have raft recovery davits). Moderate-low.",5,Equipment
11127,Buoyant apparatus,"Old term for non-inflatable throw-over flotation (no longer used on SOLAS ships, but may apply to smaller non-SOLAS craft). If present and required, should be there. Not relevant to most modern vessels. Low severity in SOLAS context.",4,Equipment
11128,Line-throwing appliance,"A pyrotechnic line-throwing device for rescue operations (SOLAS III). If missing or expired, the ship cannot shoot a line to another ship or person at distance. PSC will require replenishment. It’s rarely used but required, so minor to moderate. (They often check expiration of rockets in it along with flares.)",4,Equipment
11129,Operational readiness of lifesaving appliances,"A general code indicating that LSA weren’t in ready condition. PSC might use this if, for example, multiple LSA issues were found: some lifejackets inaccessible, lifeboat not ready for immediate launch, etc. It signals an ISM failure to keep LSA ready. We assign 8 since typically it accompanies serious findings like “many appliances not ready = big safety culture problem.”",8,Equipment
11130,"Evaluation, testing and approval","Possibly about ensuring LSA are of approved type and regularly tested (e.g., lifeboat release gear annual tests, liferaft service). If PSC finds, say, a non-approved lifebuoy or unapproved retrofitted ladder in lifeboat, they cite it. Or if required periodic servicing wasn’t done (e.g., no record of 5-year dynamometer test of davit winch brake), they use this code. It’s an ISM/maintenance compliance issue. Score 6.",6,Equipment
11131,On board training and instructions,"Crew must receive instructions on LSA use (SOLAS III/Reg.35) and participate in regular training. If PSC sees crew mishandling LSA or unfamiliar with launching, they might cite this (in addition to drill performance code). It overlaps with fire/emergency drill performance but specifically LSA-related. Score 5 normally; if crew are really clueless, it becomes an ISM detention anyway.",5,Equipment
11132,Maintenance and inspections,"SOLAS III/20 requires weekly and monthly inspections of LSA and records in log. If PSC finds no evidence of these (e.g., the lifeboat falls were never inspected/lubricated, or no log entries of weekly lifejacket count), it indicates poor maintenance that often correlates with actual defects. They will issue an ISM-related deficiency. Score 7 – preventative maintenance lapse on critical equipment.",7,Equipment
11134,Operation of Life Saving Appliances,"If during PSC the crew demonstrated inability to operate LSA properly (e.g., they didn’t know how to free-fall launch, or couldn’t start lifeboat engine, etc.), PSC will consider the ship unsafe. It’s similar to 04109/04110 but specifically about LSA. Likely detention until crew are retrained or issue fixed, as it’s an operational failure with potentially fatal consequences. Score 8.",8,Equipment
11135,Maintenance of Life Saving Appliances,"Overlap with 11132, but maybe emphasizing actual condition rather than record-keeping. If PSC finds, say, cracked lifeboat hull due to poor maintenance or severely corroded davit because it wasn’t painted, they’ll use this. It’s high – if maintenance is so poor that LSA integrity is in doubt, detention is likely until repairs. Score 7.",7,Equipment
11199,Other (life saving),Any other LSA issue not covered (maybe something like “rescue boat launching area not illuminated” or “lifeboat engine fuel low” etc.). Generally treat as high given life-saving context.,7,Equipment
00012,Dangerous Goods,,,Process
12101,Stowage/segregation/packaging of dangerous goods,"(IMDG Code) For packaged dangerous goods (containers, drums), the IMDG Code dictates segregation (e.g., oxidizers away from flammables) and proper packaging. If PSC finds incompatible DG stowed together (say acids over cyanides, or flammable and oxidizer adjacent) or damaged packaging (leaking drums), it’s a critical hazard. They will likely stop cargo operations and detain until re-stow or removal of the offending car3】. This is one of the most serious cargo issues – mishandling of DG has caused deadly explosions (e.g., Beirut 2020). Score 9.",9,Process
12102,Dangerous liquid chemicals in bulk,"(IBC Code) Chemical tankers must have a Certificate of Fitness listing allowed cargoes and corresponding required ship equipment (e.g., vent scrubbers, specialized materials). If the ship carries a chemical it isn’t certified for (e.g., a toxic cargo without appropriate ventilation system), that’s detainable – environment and crew at risk. Also if required equipment for certain cargoes (like special gauging devices for toxic products) is not working, it’s severe. PSC will make the ship remove or not load that cargo until compliance. Score 8.",8,Process
12103,Liquefied gases in bulk,"(IGC Code) LNG/LPG carriers also have stringent requirements. Any deviation (like carrying a gas without proper tank design or failing to meet temperature/pressure control due to equipment failure) is extremely dangerous. PSC will detain a gas carrier with major equipment faults (e.g., inoperative cargo tank pressure relief or dump valves), as a minor leak or overpressure can cause catastrophic BLEVE. Score 8.",8,Process
12104,Dangerous goods code,"Possibly a generic reference to compliance with the IMDG Code documentation and requirements. If the ship’s Dangerous Goods Document or special list/manifest is missing or inaccurate, it’s a compliance issue and a safety risk for emergency responders not knowing what’s on board. PSC will require the correct paperwork – moderately high importance (especially for shore firefighters).",7,Process
12105,Temperature control,"Some DG and bulk liquids require temperature control to prevent dangerous reactions (e.g., certain organic peroxides must be kept refrigerated, certain cargoes need heating to remain pumpable but not overheated). If PSC finds a temperature-controlled DG cargo not being maintained within safe limits (e.g., a reefer container of polymerizing material at too high a temp), or a tanker heating a cargo above its safety limit, they will intervene – either requiring immediate correction or offloading the cargo. Score 8 – mishandling can lead to explosion or cargo self-ignition.",8,Process
12106,Instrumentation,"Tankers carrying dangerous liquids must have instruments like gas detectors, tank pressure sensors, oxygen analyzers, etc., depending on cargo. For example, carrying toxic vinyl chloride requires continuous tank pressure monitoring and alarms. If key instruments for monitoring cargo condition are not working, it’s serious – crew might not detect dangerous situations (overpressure, toxic leaks). PSC likely detains until fixed or imposes operational restrictions. Score 7.",7,Process
12107,Fire protection cargo deck area,"Tankers carrying dangerous cargo need specific fire protection on deck (e.g., fixed foam monitors covering cargo manifolds, water spray on LPG tank domes). If these systems are inoperable or inadequate, any deck fire during cargo transfer could escalate uncontrollably. PSC often tests foam systems on tankers; a failed foam system is usually detention until repair0】. Score 8.",8,Process
12108,Personal protection,"On chemical tankers, the crew must have personal protective gear per IBC Code (like chemical suits, respirators) for emergency response to spills. If these are missing or unusable, crew cannot safely address leaks – a major hazard. PSC will detain a chemical tanker without required PPE (for example, no suitable acid suits when carrying strong acids) until gear is provided. Also, even on general ships carrying some dangerous goods, relevant PPE must be aboard (e.g., breathing apparatus for toxic gas containers). Score 7.",7,Process
12109,Special requirements,"Many dangerous cargoes have additional specific requirements (e.g., inhibited chemicals need a certificate of inhibitor, certain toxic cargoes require double isolation of valves). If these special provisions (not easily categorized generally) aren’t met, it’s a serious safety gap. PSC will enforce these strictly – e.g., if a stabilizer inhibitor certificate for a polymerizing monomer is not provided, they might refuse loading or detain ship until cargo proven sa3】. Score 7.",7,Process
12110,Tank entry,"Refers to safety of entering cargo tanks (likely overlapping with enclosed space entry but specific to cargo tank cleaning/maintenance). If PSC finds that tank entry procedures for dangerous cargo tanks aren’t followed or required gas-free certificates aren’t obtained, that’s extremely dangerous (crew could be overcome by toxic vapors or low oxygen). This is an ISM and chemical code violation – high severity. They might detain operations until proper tank gas-freeing and certification is done. Score 8.",8,Process
12112,Dangerous goods or harmful substances in pack. Form,"(MARPOL Annex III) This likely pertains to the environmental aspect of packaged DG (“Marine Pollutants”). If such substances are carried, they must be properly marked and documented as Marine Pollutant and properly stowed to prevent pollution in case of loss. PSC checks that marine pollutant cargoes have proper labels (the “fish and tree” symbol) and segregation. If not, it’s a MARPOL Annex III breach – moderate severity: not immediately unsafe to ship structure but environmentally important. They’ll require proper marking and record it. Score 6.",6,Process
12199,Other (tankers),"Any other requirement for tankers not covered – could be something like deck water spray system on LPG carriers (if not covered above), or specialist equipment for particular cargo. Usually moderate-high by default since tanker issues are potentially severe.",7,Process
00013,Propulsion and auxiliary machinery,,,Equipment
13101,Propulsion main engine,"If the main engine cannot be relied upon (e.g., it fails to start or keep running, or critical components are broken), the ship essentially can’t sail safely. PSC will detain a ship for any major main engine deficiency – for example, if during sea trial the engine failed to reverse, or it broke down entering port. Often a ship with engine trouble is detained until repairs and class verificati7】. This is maximum severity: loss of propulsion has caused many groundings.",10,Equipment
13102,Auxiliary engine,"Auxiliary engines (generators) provide electrical power. If one generator is down but others suffice, it’s noted but not detaining as redundancy remains. However, if the ship does not have redundancy (e.g., one generator of two is busted leaving no backup) or if total generation is insufficient, PSC will detain it – power loss can lead to blackouts, navigation failure, and inability to fight fires. We score 8 – often two of three DGs can be out and still not detainable if port-hop to repair, but one of one out is a show-stopper.",8,Equipment
13103,"Gauges, thermometers etc.","All machinery should have functioning gauges (oil pressure, temperature) so crew can monitor it. If many gauges are broken, crew might miss a problem (like overheating) until it causes failure or fire. PSC will cite missing/defective indicators – not immediately detainable if crew have alternate means, but it’s an ISM issue to fix. Moderate severity (crew should fix gauges promptly to avoid undetected issues).",5,Equipment
13104,Bilge pumping arrangements,"Being able to pump out water (bilges) is crucial. If bilge pumps in engine room or holds aren’t working, or valves are seized, the ship could flood slowly and not manage it, risking foundering. PSC often tests bilge pumps (especially after seeing oily water in bilges – also ties to MARPOL). A nonfunctional bilge system is detainable – vessel can’t be allowed to sail until it can dewater itself in an emergency. Score 9.",9,Equipment
13105,UMS-ship,"If a ship is certified for Unattended Machinery Space operation but PSC finds it doesn’t meet UMS standards (e.g., alarms unreliable, or automation not functioning), they may remove the UMS notation (require manned engine room). They won’t necessarily detain the ship if it can sail with engineers on watch 24/7, but if crew size is small, that becomes an issue. This is moderate – it affects operation mode rather than immediate safety if mitigated by manning.",6,Equipment
13106,Insulation wetted through (oil),Oil-soaked insulation on engine exhausts or hot pipes is extremely dangerous – it can ignite. This code points to exactly that scenario: lagging “wetted” with oil. PSC and USCG frequently detain ships for this conditi4】 as it has caused engine room fires. It also indicates ongoing leaks not fixed – an ISM failure. Score 9 – they will demand cleaning or renewing insulation and fixing leaks before departure.,9,Equipment
13108,Operation of machinery,"Possibly used if PSC observes crew operating machinery incorrectly (maybe not using cooling system properly, or ignoring safety interlocks) or machinery that should be in operation is not (like hydraulic steering pump off when it should be on automatic). It’s a broad ISM category. Score 5 unless a specific hazardous practice is noted (then it could escalate via other codes).",5,Equipment
13199,Other (machinery),"Any other machinery issues, e.g., a cracked engine bedplate, severe vibration on shaft, non-functional emergency generators (though that’s covered in emerg systems) or unapproved modifications. This catch-all can include serious things – default to 7, but actual severity depends on what it is.",7,Equipment
00014,Pollution Prevention - MARPOL Annex I,,,Process
14101,Control of discharge of oil,"This general code implies the vessel is not properly controlling oil discharges (e.g., bypassing OWS, pumping oily bilge or sludge out illegally). If PSC suspects or has evidence (oil in water around ship, magic pipe, etc.), it’s treated with maximum severity: detention and likely referral for prosecuti​safety4sea.com8】. Oil pollution violations carry massive fines and criminal charges (whistleblower cases often fall under thi3】. Score 10.",10,Process
14102,Retention of oil on board,"The ship must retain oily residues (sludge) and oily bilge water on board until proper disposal. If PSC finds sludge tanks full with no disposal records, they suspect illegal dumping. Or if incinerator is inoperable and sludge still not landing ashore, where’s it going? Very high severity – suggests MARPOL violation. They may detain until sludge is properly disposed in port and systems fixed, plus scrutinize ORB entries. Score 9.",9,Process
14103,Segregation of oil and water ballast,"Ships must segregate fuel oil tanks and ballast tanks (also cargo oil and ballast on tankers). If PSC finds, say, a ballast tank contaminated with oil or an illegal connection between fuel and ballast systems, it’s serious (could lead to oily ballast discharge). They will detain until segregation is restored (and require cleanup of tanks). Score 8.",8,Process
14104,Oil filtering equipment,"(MARPOL I Reg.14) The Oily Water Separator and 15-ppm monitor are critical for legal bilge discharge. If the OWS is inoperable or bypassed, PSC treats it as one of the gravest deficiencies – typically detaining the vessel and investigating for intentional polluti​safety4sea.com8】. Many detentions and legal cases involve non-functional or tampered OWS equipment (e.g., magic pipe to bypas7】. Score 10. (Often accompanied by code 30 action – detention and flag/USCG informed for potential prosecution.)",10,Process
14105,"Pumping, piping and discharge arrangements","This refers to the engine room bilge and sludge pumping arrangements – PSC looks for unauthorized pipes or valves that could discharge overboard. For example, an illegal connection (“magic pipe”) from sludge tank to overboard is a smoking gun for pollution. If PSC finds any suspicious piping or disconnected seals on overboard valves, it’s immediate detention and investigati0】. Score 10 – direct evidence of MARPOL violation. (Even not having the standard discharge connection for shore could fall here, though that is minor in itself – the bigger context is bypass potential.)",10,Process
14106,Pump room bottom protection,"Tankers must have double bottoms in pump rooms or equivalent to avoid outflow if pump room floor is breached. If an older tanker lacks this or it’s not as per MARPOL, PSC would likely not allow it to carry heavy oil. This is more a design requirement flagged during certification. If PSC discovered a structural non-compliance, it’s high severity; though nowadays, older non-compliant tankers are phased out. Score 7.",7,Process
14107,Oil discharge monitoring and control system,"On crude oil tankers, the ODMC monitors oil content and total volume of cargo/ballast discharges from slop tanks. If it’s not working or calibrated, the ship legally cannot discharge any tank washings at sea. PSC will detain a tanker with inoperable ODMCS if it intends to do any discharge. Score 9 – essential to prevent illegal cargo oil discharge.",9,Process
14108,15 PPM alarm arrangements,"The oil content meter on the OWS must alarm and auto-stop discharge if >15 ppm oil. If this arrangement fails (e.g., sensor broken or bypassed), the ship could pump oil overboard without alarm. PSC treats a nonfunctional 15-ppm alarm as extremely severe – essentially the OWS is not legally complia​safety4sea.com8】. Detention until fixed, and heavy suspicion of illegal discharge. Score 10.",10,Process
14109,Oil / water interface detector,"Tankers sometimes use an interface detector to tell oil/water interface in slop tanks during decanting. If required and not working, they might accidentally pump out oil with the clean water. PSC will likely prevent decanting and insist on pumping all slops to shore or require repair. Not as universally critical as other equipment. Score 6.",6,Process
14110,Standard discharge connection,"Ships must have a standard flange to connect to shore reception facilities for oily waste. If missing, it’s minor (the ship can’t easily offload sludge – but they could jury-rig a hose if needed). PSC will note and require they obtain one (cheap item). Low severity.",3,Process
14111,"SBT, CBT, COW","This refers to tanker structural/configuration requirements: Segregated Ballast Tanks, Clean Ballast Tanks (older concept), and Crude Oil Washing. MARPOL required all big tankers to have SBT or equivalent by certain dates, and crude carriers to have COW systems. If a tanker is not in compliance (e.g., an older tanker still using Clean Ballast but its CBT system is inoperative, or no COW on a crude tanker), it’s likely detainable – in fact such ships shouldn’t be trading (most single-hull, non-SBT tankers are gone or restricted). If PSC finds a tanker without functional COW when required, they may not allow it to load crude until fixed. Score 9 (due to pollution risk of not washing properly or carrying dirty ballast).",9,Process
14112,COW operations and equipment manual,"Crude Oil Washing requires an approved manual and proper equipment/training. If PSC finds the COW machine not working or crew not following the manual (like skipping required tank washing before ballast voyage), they’ll detain or at least issue major deficiency. Improper COW can leave sludge (later illegally dumped) or cause safety issues (spray ignition). Score 7.",7,Process
14113,Double hull construction,"MARPOL phased in double hulls for tankers to reduce spill risk. If by some anomaly a single-hull tanker (of size >600DWT carrying heavy oil) is still trading past phase-out without exemption, PSC would detain or ban it. Double-hull structural damage could also be considered here (e.g., ballasting a full cargo tank if one side of double hull breached – not allowed). Basically, any deviation from double-hull requirement is extremely serious. Score 9.",9,Process
14114,Hydrostatically balanced loading,"An interim measure for some single-hull tankers was Hydrostatically Balanced Loading (HBL) to reduce outflow in grounding. If applicable and not being followed (e.g., a tanker that promised to do HBL as condition for continued operation but isn’t actually doing it), PSC would detain/deny it to load heavy cargo. However, since single-hulls are largely phased out, this is rare now. Score 6 historically; moot today mostly.",6,Process
14115,Condition Assessment Scheme,"CAS is an enhanced structural survey regime for older tankers beyond a certain age. Tankers subject to CAS must have a Statement of Compliance. If an aging tanker doesn’t have valid CAS documentation, PSC will view it as substandard – likely detain or at least require immediate surv7】. Score 8 – significant structural safety/pollution prevention measure.",8,Process
14116,Pollution report - MARPOL Annex I,"If there was an oil spill (even minor) and the ship did not report it as required to coastal authorities, that’s a serious violation (failure to report is illegal and impedes response). PSC will treat non-reporting as a major compliance breach – likely fines and detenti3】. E.g., if oil stains are found on deck/drip trays and ship didn’t notify anyone, they’ll suspect a spill was hidden. Score 8.",8,Process
14117,Ship type designation,"Possibly verifying the MARPOL “ship type” (for tankers, e.g., Type 1, 2, 3 for chemicals, or for oil tankers the category for phase-out). If there’s confusion or mislabeling in certs (like a tanker being operated in a way not suitable for its type), PSC notes it. But this is documentation. Moderate to low – unless it implies carrying forbidden cargo for its type, which would be handled under other codes.",5,Process
14119,Oil and oily mixtures from machinery spaces,"Possibly a general code used if PSC finds evidence the ship discharged machinery space bilges illegally (like traces of oil in overboard discharge or an unaccounted drop in bilge content). Could overlap with 14101. As a general statement, if PSC believes machinery space oily mixtures were pumped out (bypassing OWS), it’s extremely severe (detention, legal action). We give 8 assuming it’s used for suspected subtle violations (like oil sheen observed around discharge during bilge pumping test).",8,Process
14120,"Loading, unloading & cleaning procedures cargo spaces of tankers","Tankers must follow procedures to avoid spillage during loading/discharge and proper tank cleaning disposal. If PSC observes poor practices (overflowed cargo during loading, cargo hoses not drained before disconnect, not following the pre-wash required for persistent oils), they will issue deficiencies and possibly detain for major procedural lapses. Score 7 – can lead to small spills or built-up sludge (which then risks illegal disposal).",7,Process

14201,Efficient stripping,"Chemical tankers must achieve certain stripping efficiency (very little residue left after pumping out cargo). Stripping performance is ensured by design and periodic tests. If PSC finds the ship’s stripping system is not achieving required efficiency (perhaps via a test or previous history), they might require a mandatory prewash in port for each cargo (which is costly/time-consumin7】. It’s a significant environmental issue: poor stripping = more residue discharged at sea. Score 7 – they likely won’t detain the ship itself, but they will enforce additional measures (like no at-sea discharge of wash water, only to reception facility).",7,Process
14202,Residue discharge systems,"This refers to the arrangements for handling Annex II residues – special slop tanks, dedicated pump for stripping, etc. If not functioning, the ship might discharge more residue at sea than allowed. PSC will ensure any required dedicated equipment (like closed loading/unloading system) is working. If not, they can detain or restrict cargo carriage until fixed. Score 7.",7,Process
14203,Tank washing equipment,"Chemical tankers have tank washing machines, sometimes with specialized features (like machine able to reach all areas to avoid clingage). If these fail, certain cargo residues can’t be fully removed (leading to potential contamination of next cargo or illegal disposal). PSC will note it and likely require manual cleaning or fix before next voyage if it affects compliance. Moderate severity.",6,Process
14204,Prohibited discharge of NLS slops,"If PSC has evidence or strong suspicion that the ship discharged NLS (noxious liquid substances) residues at sea in contravention of Annex II (like outside allowed dilution or in a special area), that’s treated similarly to illegal oil discharge – very serious. They will detain and may seek prosecution if willful. Score 10. (Annex II violations, while less publicized than oil, are equally unlawful. E.g., illegally dumping toxic xylene rinse water = major environmental harm.)",10,Process
14205,Cargo heating systems - cat. Y substances,"Some Category Y substances (moderate hazard) require heating for efficient transfer but have limits to avoid polymerization or decomposition. If heating coils are leaking or overheating cargo beyond spec, it could cause cargo degradation or a venting of harmful vapor. PSC will address faulty heating – moderate (since it’s a prevention measure but not immediate unless cargo approaching dangerous temp).",6,Process
14206,Ventilation procedures / equipment,"For certain Annex II cargoes, tanks may need venting before/after cleaning (and some fumes must be treated).

They will likely stop loading/unloading those until repackaged. High moderate severity – improper packaging can lead to spillage of toxins.",7,Process
14302,Marking and labelling,"Each package containing a harmful substance must bear the marine pollutant mark (if applicable) and proper hazard labels. If not, responders might not know it’s environmentally hazardous if lost overboard.

14303,Documentation (MARPOL Annex III),"The ship must have a special list/manifest of all harmful substances on board, including their location, for use in emergencies. If missing or incomplete, it’s moderate – PSC insists on proper manifests. Not detainable by itself if info can be compiled quickly, but a gap to close.",5,Process
14304,Stowage,"Harmful substances should be stowed so as to minimize risk to marine environment (e.g., not on weather deck if avoidable, or in a way to contain leaks). If PSC sees extremely poor stowage (like barrels of pollutants on deck with no lashings, at risk of falling overboard), that’s serious. They’ll stop operations to secure it. Score 6.

14402,Sewage treatment plan,"If the vessel has an STP (sewage treatment plant) and it’s not working (can’t treat sewage to required standard), the ship must stop discharging sewage at sea and either use a holding tank or get shore disposal. If in an area where discharge (even treated) is banned, the immediate operational impact is minimal (just don’t discharge). But in open ocean, inability to treat means ship must carry sewage – limited capacity. For passenger ships or larger crews, that becomes untenable quickly. PSC in places like Alaska or Baltic where rules are strict will detain ships that cannot manage sewage properly until fixed.

14601,"Technical Files and if applicable, monitoring manual","Every engine >130 kW has a NOx Technical File (detailing components, settings for compliance). Also, ships with scrubbers need Monitoring Plans for emissions, and those in EU MRV or IMO DCS have CO₂ monitoring plans. If these documents are missing, the ship may be running engines not verified for NOx compliance or scrubbers not properly monitored. PSC will likely detain if they suspect engine NOx non-compliance (less common than fuel issues). If just documentation oversight, moderate – but they’ll insist on obtaining it. Score 5.",5,Process
14602,Record book engine parameters,"If any modifications are done to engines, changes must be recorded to ensure still within NOx limits. If PSC finds no record book or entries despite obvious changes (e.g., fuel injectors replaced with non-original type), they suspect a NOx violation. This is moderate – they might require a re-certification test for NOx if serious. It’s more about paperwork showing NOx compliance maintained. Score 5.",5,Process

If missing, PSC won’t be confident the scrubber meets regulations. Since scrubbers allow higher sulfur fuel usage, lack of approved docs could mean illegal SOx emissions. They might detain or at least not accept the scrubber operation (forcing the ship to use compliant fuel). Score 7.",7,Process

If BDNs are missing or have obviously non-compliant info (like 3.5% sulfur fuel taken in 2021 without scrubber), that’s a major breach. PSC will sample fuel to confirm sulfur content. Missing BDNs also hinder verifying compliance – high severity because it might hide illegal fuel use. Many port states (e.g., in EU) can fine or detain ships that cannot produce recent BDNs. Score 8.",8,Process
14605,Type approval certificate of incinerator,"Shipboard incinerators need to be type-approved to ensure they meet emission standards (no emitting too much CO, etc.). If the incinerator has no type approval or is modified, it may violate Annex VI Reg.16. PSC will note it and likely prohibit its use until proper documentation or unit replacement. It’s moderate to low – incinerator use is mostly a convenience for reducing garbage volume (some ports ironically prefer you not use it due to local air). Score 4.",4,Process
14606,Diesel engine air pollution control,"Possibly refers to verifying engines meet NOx Tier standards or if an “Approved Method” retrofit (for certain older engines) is applied. If PSC finds an engine missing required emission control devices (like a Tier I engine that had an approved upgrade kit available but not installed), they may report it to flag for enforcement. Or if an engine appears tampered (like NOx bypass valves open), they’ll take it seriously. Score 7 – because circumventing NOx controls is illegal and contributes to acid rain/health issues.

If PSC finds improper use (like burning plastic in port creating black smoke, which is not allowed under Annex VI), they’ll cite it. Or if the operating manual is missing such that crew may not know what’s permitted to incinerate, they’ll note it. Score 5.",5,Process

If PSC sees, say, in logbook that they entered ECA but only changed fuel 2 hours late, that’s a violation. They could fine or detain depending on how they interpret it. Score 5 – moderate but can have serious consequences if it resulted in high emissions in restricted area.",5,Process
14611,Ozone depleting substances,"If the ship has equipment with CFC refrigerants or Halon and it’s not properly managed (leaks, no records), that’s an Annex VI violation. E.g., if PSC finds crew vented refrigerant gas to atmosphere without recovery during maintenance, that’s illegal. Or if the ODS Record Book isn’t kept, they suspect maybe illegal release. Medium-high severity – global environmental harm. Some port states (like US) penalize deliberate ODS release heavily. Score 7.",7,Process

If such an engine has an Approved Method published but the ship hasn’t installed it by the deadline, it’s not allowed to use that engine beyond a certain date. PSC will enforce this – could detain the ship or require it to limit engine use until compliance. It’s specific and not common lately as many such engines are retired or kits installed. Score 6.",6,Process
